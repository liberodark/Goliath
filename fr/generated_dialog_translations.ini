089_start_node0=[You enter the room but before you announce yourself, you overhear a conversation between the Forger Leader and a robot underling] Lucifred: ...and that's the best advice you can give? You tin-plated moron! You think I should just find out what they want and give it to them? Robot-Negotiator: It is the wisest move, sir -- they are too valuable to lose. Lucifred: Shut up.
089_start_node1=Lucifred: Who is-- ohh, yes, the young human I have heard so much about. Welcome, friend, to the headquarters of the Forgers. Please don't mind the extremely unhelpful bucket of bolts. He is beneath the notice of important beings such as we two.
089_start_node2=Word has traveled quickly about your deeds. It seems you are an expert in getting things done in this land, and that you greatly desire something that we can give. Is that right?
089_start_node3=Hmm. Unlike some, I always pay my debts, so if you do something for me, I will certainly deliver you to the proper place. Now, at the moment, I have a problem with a certain supplier of valuable ores for our industrial endeavors. You seem to have a knack for dealing with tough customers, and you have your own transportation. Are you interested?
089_start_node4=Fair enough. I understand that. And I understand that you are from another place, so you are unaware of how far my reputation reaches. Even the lowliest of the beings in our domain knows what I can accomplish when I am properly compensated. In fact, you can ask my fool robot. Even he will say that I always do what I promise, as long as I get what I want. And then get going to the supplier. I don't have all day.
089_start_node5=Strange things happen in the world. Power of the Center is growing and spreading, traveling becomes more and more difficult. Many paths were erased, and the coordinates became out of date. This complicates the trade, and these robots here are really amiss!
089_start_node6=The Center of the world is the key to everything. According to the legend, there is a Citadel where all desires are fulfilled, but how can anybody there - that's what no one knows. I could ask around, but I need a service in return.
089_start_node7=On a nearby shard there is a mining town that provides us with ore. Ore stopped coming. We need to figure out what's wrong. In any case, you can apply the harshest measures.
089_start_transition0_1=Uh... >ahem<
089_start_transition1_1=Uh, all right.
089_start_transition2_1=I would like to make my way back to my homeworld. No one has been terribly helpful with that, but they sent me here.
089_start_transition3_1=I'm always interested, but this time I want to know that you have the goods before I go charging off all over the place.
089_start_transition4_1=All right then.
089_start_transition5_1=How to get out of here?
089_start_transition6_1=What service?
089_start_transition7_1=I will do it.
089_finish_node0=Ah, did those backward looking fools accept our generous offer?
089_finish_node1=Well, maybe this 1000 gold will ease your mind, if you're so concerned. And there is one more reward - our knowledge about metals. Your robots are impressive, but with Forgers technologies... You will be surprised.
089_finish_transition0_1=They did. I don't feel good about it, though.
089_finish_transition1_1=I guess.
089_gnarks_leader_node0=Human! Stay away or you will be attacked! This city is under the control of the gnarks!
089_gnarks_leader_node1=Eh? You don't want to fight? You wish to gnark diplomacy? Very well. This city is the holy land of our ancestors, human. The Forgers have come in and gnarked it for their own purposes, destroying relics and desecrating holy places. They must stop, or there will never be peace.
089_gnarks_leader_node2=Don't be so certain, human. The Forgers have gnarked their way through so many places, destroyed and desecrated the work of so many, that I believe that nothing but force will stop them.
089_gnarks_leader_transition0_1=Okay, wait, hold on. I'm here as an ambassador. I gnarked your language so that we can talk instead of fight.
089_gnarks_leader_transition1_1=I never ... uh, gnarked at it that way. Okay, I'll go and tell them. I'm sure they will stop.
089_gnarks_leader_transition2_1=That may be, I will try, though.
089_gnarks_leader_final_node0=Welcome back, human. Have you gnarked the accursed Forgers to see sense? I knew talking it out would work.
089_gnarks_leader_final_node1=These Forgers! Gnark their lack of honor! I should have known! Well, what if we refuse their insulting offer?
089_gnarks_leader_final_transition0_1=I... don't know how to tell you this, but the Forgers refuse to stop. They don't think that it's important to keep your city intact. And uh... I guess I'm here to give you their offer: they will pay you part of the money they make in exchange for access to the city.
089_gnarks_leader_final_transition1_1=Aaahh... They s-said that they would uh... gnark sure that all of the gnarks in the city were killed.
089_dont_understand_gnarks_node0=Gnark gnark gnark-gnark!
089_dont_understand_gnarks_node1=GNARK GNARK! [angrily bashes the ground]
089_dont_understand_gnarks_transition0_1=Uh... I don't know what you're saying.
089_dont_understand_gnarks_transition1_1=Okay, so I guess polite conversation is out...
089_smiths_leader_node0=Well, then, human, have you destroyed all of the filthy savage gnarks in the city? Time's a'wasting; we need to get back to digging up raw materials, you know.
089_smiths_leader_node1=PFF! Okay, Mr. Soft Heart. Boo hoo for the poor gnarks and their stupid trinkets. Tell them they can have 50 -- no, 25% of what we make on the junk we find in their land, if they're going to whine about it. That should make them happy. Otherwise, wipe 'em out. They've already cost us too much time.
089_smiths_leader_transition0_1=I've spoken to the Gnark leader. They're not savages-- they're trying to protect their holy sites from being dug up.
089_smiths_leader_transition1_1=W-wipe them out? O-okay, I'll make sure they take the offer.
091_start_node0=>bzzt ding< Hello, human. I would have introduced myself to you. My designation is T4LK3R. I am a robo-diplomat.
091_start_node1=>zzt< Lucifred knows much. But he is a fool in most other ways. For many months, I have tried to negotiate trade deals between factions of creatures. Trade keeps everyone happy, which stops wars. This creates peace, which is logical. I have created trade agreements between Gnarks, Golems, and Trolls. These creatures, while primitive and quick to anger, are approximately 71.4 times easier to deal with than Lucifred and the Forgers.
091_start_node2=>zzrrt< He does not think that I am a worthy diplomat because I am made of metal. Nothing I do will convince hm of this. It goes against my programming, but I am angry, and I wish to quit.
091_start_node3=>klik ding< If you wish to make an agreement between the Forgers and the three savage tribes, you are welcome to it. I will even sell you a translator so you can make it easier.
091_start_transition0_1=Ah, nice to meet you. I'm Gromov. I have a quick question. I need to find my way home, off this shard, and off this whole world. Do you think Lucifred the Forger has the ability to do it?
091_start_transition1_1=Really? Why? Lucifred seems like he's always up for a deal.
091_start_transition1_2=I dont have enough coins. I'll be back soon.
091_start_transition2_1=Hold on, hold on! Maybe I can help.
091_start_transition3_1=A translator, huh? How much?
091_finish_node0=>gzzt< Oh. You found me. I was just about to skip town. It was illogical for me to stay around when the Forgers are such stupid jerks.
091_finish_node1=>bzzt< Oh. Very interesting. I didn't know what that word meant. Ohh. That's bad. I've been insulting the Gnarks' mothers for about 5 years.
091_finish_transition0_1=Check it out. I can communicate with all the Gnarks, Golems, and Trolls now. In fact, we're all pretty good friends.
091_finish_transition1_1=Anyway, have a nice trip. Thought you might be interested.
092_start_node0=Gnark! Gnark Gnark!
092_start_node1=[Gnark enthusiastically jumps up and down] Gnark Gnark!
092_start_transition0_1=Uh... Do you want me to...? [point at best guess]
092_start_transition1_1=...What are you doing? Are you taking me somewhere to learn?
092_gnark_savage_node0=Now you are able to understand us, fella?
092_gnark_savage_node1=Good.
092_gnark_savage_transition0_1=Yes, I started to understand you.
092_gnark_savage_transition1_1=Thanks.
093_start_node0=[the golems hum quietly as you go past]
093_start_node1=Hmm hmm humm hrmm Hmm-HM!! [Translator: We golems see you. Stop or else!]
093_start_transition0_1=Interesting. They don't do much, do they? I wonder what it would take to get them to talk. I need to hear them speak so the translator can pick it up. [pick up smallest stone]
093_start_transition1_1=Aha, we're getting somewhere now. They talk when they're provoked. I wonder what they'll say if I grab the rock from this holy-looking shrine thing.
093_golem_savage_node0=Well, why did you touch our Holy Rock?
093_golem_savage_node1=Don't do that again.
093_golem_savage_transition0_1=Now, I understand your language. I've just provoked you.
093_golem_savage_transition1_1=Ok.
094_start_node0=Dunkle Bort! Za Kroog la Foz Yog. Krob la! [Translator: Troll Ally! In Kroog is Wild Foz. Krob them!]
094_start_node1=[troll shrugs and points you toward the lair]
094_start_transition0_1=Hmm. Dunkle Bort.
094_start_transition1_1=Somebody in there that you want me to meet, trade with, or kill? It would sure be nice to have a little more information going in...
094_troll_savage_node0=Oh! What this? Us Trolls now talk with you easy? Very good!
094_troll_savage_node1=Yes. You friend. Now no trolls attack you on you's journey. As long as you no attack us, look at us with funny, or smell bad.
094_troll_savage_transition0_1=Yes. Me talk good to you. Me Troll Ally.
094_troll_savage_transition1_1=Me thank you...I think.
091_start_transition0_3=Well, did you get the money?
091_start_transition0_4=Not yet.
091_start_transition0_5=Yes, take your 1000.
091_start_transition1_3=Congratulations on your purchase. Pay attention to this - to work properly the translating machine needs vocabulary. It must be filled with words, as many as you manage.
091_start_transition1_4=What do i need to do?
091_start_transition2_3=Go to the golems, gnarks and trolls. Try to find a common language with them. The most important - they have to speak with you, give you words. The machine will gather all this and analyze. That's how you will learn their language.
091_start_transition2_4=Great, I get going.
091_return_buy_node0=>gzzt< You are back. Do you have the money now?
091_return_buy_node1=>ding ding< Excellent. Here is the translator. It will require many interactions with the creatures in order to build its vocabulary. I wish you luck. You will need it with Lucifred.
091_return_buy_node2=Go to the golems, gnarks and trolls. Try to find a common language with them. The most important - they have to speak with you, give you words. The machine will gather all this and analyze. That's how you will learn their language.
091_return_buy_transition0_1=Sheesh, I forgot!
091_return_buy_transition0_2=Yep, here you go, 1000 gold.
091_return_buy_transition1_1=All right. This should be interesting.
091_return_buy_transition2_1=Great, I get going.
094_troll_kill_south_node0=Bork! Dunkle Bort bos Krob la Foz Yog! [Translator: Bork! Troll Bort has Krob the Foz Monsters!]
094_troll_kill_south_node1=[troll cheers]
094_troll_kill_south_transition0_1=Krob la Foz Yog! [Smash the Wild Monsters!]
094_troll_kill_south_transition1_1=YEAH! TROLLS!
094_troll_kill_north_node0=Bork! Dunkle Bort bos Krob la Foz Yog! [Translator: Bork! Troll Bort has Krob the Foz Monsters!]
094_troll_kill_north_node1=[troll pats you on the back]
094_troll_kill_north_transition0_1=Um... Bork? [Translator: Interesting?]
094_troll_kill_north_transition1_1=I think that's right.
094_troll_kill_east_node0=Bork! Dunkle Bort bos Krob la Foz Yog! [Translator: Bork! Troll Bort has Krob the Foz Monsters!]
094_troll_kill_east_node1=[Troll offers you a hug]
094_troll_kill_east_transition0_1=Dunkle Bort. [Translator: Troll Ally]
094_troll_kill_east_transition1_1=Cool. You guys are all right.
092_after_fight_1_node0=Gnark Gnark!
092_after_fight_1_transition0_1=Hmm, I guess Gnarks teach through combat?
092_after_fight_2_node0=Gnark Gnark! Gnark!! [Translator: Gnark Your Mother! Gnark!!]
092_after_fight_2_transition0_1=Whew! Tough lesson. The translator appear to be picking this up now.
092_finish_node0=Human!! Can you Gnark us now?
092_finish_node1=That's just Gnark! I gnarked you would gnark it sooner or later! You did a really gnark job gnarking those missions.
092_finish_transition0_1=Oh! Uh, yeah, I can ...gnark... you... pretty well, I guess.
092_finish_transition1_1=Umm... Well, gnark you very much.
093_finish_node0=Hmm-hmm. You talk to Golems now. Give back Hmm-Hm.
093_finish_node1=Нmm-hm. You humans say "stone." We golems say "child."
093_finish_transition0_1=Hmm-Hm? What's that?
093_finish_transition1_1=Oh! Oh my goodness. Here you go. Sorry!
095_start_node0=Ahh, here you are again, Young Human. I know you have traveled much of this world. You seem like a sharp chap. Tell me, do you know the language of the Trolls?
095_start_node1=I know much, but the Trolls and their ways are a mystery to me. We know they are useful in trade, but when we sent out our trade negotiator, he never came back. Perhaps as a favor to us, you can go and investigate this disappearance. I would be very grateful.
095_start_transition0_1=As a matter of fact, I do.
095_start_transition1_1=Very well.
095_troll_guard_1_node0=Who be you? Make-talk to prisoner not let-happen! You go far away!
095_troll_guard_1_node1=Him dig under-ground in camp! Take shiny bars away from Trolls! Very greedy! Smell like you's suit!
095_troll_guard_1_transition0_1=Okay, okay, hold on. Me here to solve problem. Who is prisoner, and what him done?
095_troll_guard_1_transition1_1=Him smell like MY suit? Like ...motor oil?
095_troll_guard_2_node0=You! Why you back?
095_troll_guard_2_node1=What? So now we has to free prisoner? And we has to say him sorry? Uuugghh. Us hate to do both those things! But okay.
095_troll_guard_2_transition0_1=Me figure out what real problem is! It not prisoner who steal shiny bars. It Robots. But me strong, and smart, and send them away!
095_troll_guard_2_transition1_1=Me thank you, Troll Friend.
096_start_node0=YARR! What be this, a Pretend Robot? It walk like a robot yet have the heart of a person. MAKE UP YER MIND, says I! What be your business here?
096_start_node1=PAH! I may as well say that all the cows need ye to stop eating them! What care I what dumb savages think or don't think?
096_start_transition0_1=Captain, I've figured out that it is your crew who is stealing scrap metal from the Trolls. They need you to stop doing that.
096_start_transition1_1=Now listen, if you would bother to learn some of the Trolls' language, you would know: they are intelligent beings. Y'know, kind of. They need scrap metal for the same reasons you do: this world is built on the wreckage of the past.
096_finish_node0=ARR! Ye return, Pretend Robot! Have ye found a scrap-hunting world for me and me crew?
096_finish_node1=Arr, ye be a rare one, Pretend Robot. Flag us down next time ye see our ship, and we shall help ye as best we can!
096_finish_transition0_1=Whew! I did! I've cleared the land of the Ice Golems and the Snow Leopards. You can get scrap metal there to your heart's content!
096_finish_transition1_1=Will do!
095_free_trader_node0=You set me free. Many thanks!
095_free_trader_node1=Like two drops! His name is Willy. He lives in a small town. You can just ask, everybody knows him. He's a Sheriff!
095_free_trader_transition0_1=So, you know a man who looks like me?
095_free_trader_transition1_1=Thanks, I'll go there.
097_start_node0=Yarr, who be it? Oh, it is ye, Pretend-Robot again! Isn't this a treat. What can I do for ye?
097_start_node1=Aye, and not like ye, Pretend-Robot! HAR HAR HAR! Arr, that be a good joke. Anyways, The Created, eh? Aye, I surely have that information. But it comes at a pretty price, don't ye know!
097_start_transition0_1=Hi, nice to see you as well. I'm looking for a group called The Created. They sound like they are robots, like you.
097_start_transition1_1=I expected as much. What would you like me to do?
097_finish_node0=Yarr! Ye be back! Ben! We missed ye! Wait, did ye kill him to get him out of there?
097_finish_node1=Ben: I'm alive again!
097_finish_transition0_1=Oops, sorry, wait a second. [put Ben's battery back in]
097_finish_transition1_1=Simple as pie. Now, as for that information about the Created, my friend...
098_start_node0=Thanks, pardner, you really saved me there. Them Gnarks are a tough bunch of hombres, I'll tell you that. I ain't seen anything like them since I stopped that band of desperados back in Texas.
098_start_node1=Aw, I don't know about that, friend. Back where I'm from, there ain't much happening. I was a small town sheriff and all I ever got to do was get the drunks off the ground in the morning. That ain't no life for a thrill-seeker such as myself! But here, heck, amigo, the threats fly around fast and furious! Captured by this 'un, attacked by that 'un, boy, it's a real thrill! I don't ever want to go back!
098_start_transition0_1=Texas! So you're from America! Maybe we can work to get back to Earth together!
098_start_transition1_1=But-- you've got to want to get back to your family, right?
100_start_node0=WHO BE YOU?
100_start_node1=ARE YE PREPARED TO PAY THE PRICE??
100_start_transition0_1=I'm just here to ask you about the map. Th-the map to the Created headquarters.
100_start_transition1_1=You mean ...money?
099_start_node0=Oh, that. Arr har har. That ... be a little bit of a sticking point because I be lying when I told ye that. I can't help it, laddie, I be a pirate! But there be a treasure hunter who knows all about the ones ye be looking for. He be here on yer map. But he's a bit of a prickly one.
099_start_node1=Let me say he might not be all that ready to just hand it over. He was one of us, indeed he was, but shall we say, he couldn't fit in with us pirates of ...more refined manners.
099_start_transition0_1=Prickly?
099_start_transition1_1=I"m a little tired of being sent all over....
100_speak_after_fight_node0=YE HAVE DEFEATED ME. BUT YE HAVE NOT YET PAID THE PRICE.
100_speak_after_fight_node1=I DON'T WANT YE TO KILL ME. ALL I EVER WANTED WAS FOR SOMEONE TO SAY "THANK YE FOR ALL YER HARD WORK."
100_speak_after_fight_transition0_1=Come on, man, I don't want to have to kill you.
100_speak_after_fight_transition0_2=*Leave*
100_speak_after_fight_transition1_1=Oh. Okay, thanks! You've done a good job.
101_start_node0=Stone Pants, you have done a wonderful job for us! Smart, resourceful, quick-witted, strong, and brave. I salute you. Now it is time for me to pay you back, and tell you how to get back to your home.
101_start_node1=Ah! Right! Well, the truth is that I don't know where any of that stuff is. But I do know of a creature called the Collector. He knows many things; perhaps he will know of the place you are looking for.
101_start_transition0_1=Fantastic. This has been a lot of work, so I'm happy to be able to be finished now. Where is it?
101_start_transition1_1=A-are you kidding me? After doing all that work for you and for the rats, and ... and... You're telling me that I need to go find someone ELSE who MIGHT know something about it???
087_start_node0=Ahh, welcome, traveler. I see you and I are both strangers in this land. The difference, of course, is that I know much and you know little. So this is our friendship, then: you come to me for knowledge, and I will ask for riches in return. What do you wish, friend?
087_start_node1=Yes, well, nothing is free, my young friend. I look at your marvelous battle suits you have created, and it occurs to me: a certain item I thought was impossible to acquire may not be so impossible after all. Deep within the planet sits The Stone of Omnipotence, a very valuable stone to the right people. I sent someone like you to find it-- as I recall, he was wanting to get to his home as well -- but he never came back. What happened to him, I cannot say. But you may have different luck.
087_start_transition0_1=I've worked really hard to get here. I crashed my plane, I built these battle suits, I solved problems for two different factions. Please, I have a friend who's lost, and I'm just trying to get back home. To my REAL home, on Earth.
087_start_transition0_2=Wait here.
087_start_transition1_1=Okay. I will do what I need to do to get that for you, but doesn't anyone just offer information for free around here?
087_finish_node0=My young friend Mr. Gromov! You're back! Ex-cellent! And is that the Stone of Ominpotence I see in your robotic hands? My, my, aren't you resourceful?
087_finish_node1=One moment: I see you're back too, Philip. It seems you've screwed this mission up too. Typical. You're fired, by the way. Get out of my office. Now, Mr. Gromov, what were you saying?
087_finish_transition0_1=Yes, thanks. I should tell you: the stone is dangerous; it can--
087_finish_transition1_1=Uh, yeah, the Stone's dangerous. If you touch it, it will turn you into a terrifying creature. So please be careful.
102_start_node0=Here is what you came for: a map to take you to my countrymen, the Forgers. I am sure they can help you find your friend and get home.
102_start_node1=Take the coordinates.
102_start_transition0_1=At this point, I'm not even surprised that you're just giving me more to do.
102_start_transition1_1=Got it. Thanks.
IC_002_start_node0=>skkssskk< Gromov? You there? I've heard some rumors about the world you're on. It sounds like the >skkssk< folks who could help you the most are the Forest Brotherhood. >kssks<
IC_002_start_node1=No, it's worse than that. >kssks< They're not people, and they're not related to each other. They're >hsskskks<
IC_002_start_node2=I said, they're >ffsskkksks< that are extremely >sskksksks< when they >kskksksk<
IC_002_start_node3=[silence]
IC_002_start_transition0_1=The Forest Brotherhood? So a bunch of guys who are related to each other just hanging out in the forest?
IC_002_start_transition1_1=Sorry I didn't get that. Repeat please. Over.
IC_002_start_transition2_1=*shake the radio set*
IC_002_start_transition3_1=*turn off the radio set and sigh mournfully*
IC_002_guard_new_node0=Rooty Toot Toot! Hail and well met, stranger! Welcome to the Forest Brotherhood. You appear to be friendly, but my goodness, one just doesn't know. Ho ho! Might I inquire what your business is in this part of the Murk, Murkwood?
IC_002_guard_new_node1=I see. Oh yes, Indeed I do! Hoo hoo! The leader is away at the moment. In fact, he is on a mission. A marvelous mission! A mission to save the Foxes' very livelihood! But who might you be, and why would you like to see him?
IC_002_guard_new_node2=Very good! The Forest Brotherhood is always happy to help those on a mission. Our leader is to the north of here, and if you were to join his group and help them on their secret mission, he would be sure to do whatever he can to assist you! Godspeed and farewell!
IC_002_guard_new_node3=How rude. Very well, I will tell you that he is a great distance from here on an expedition either North or South. I cannot say which. It is a riddle!
IC_002_guard_new_transition0_1=Uh... hi. I'd like to talk with your leader. I've got to figure out how to get out of here.
IC_002_guard_new_transition1_1=My name is Gromov. I'm not from here. I need some help to get home.
IC_002_guard_new_transition1_2=My name is none of your business, and coincidentally, my reasons are none of your business, too.
IC_002_guard_new_transition2_1=Okay, thanks a bunch, Fox Man!
IC_002_guard_new_transition3_1=Humph.
IC_002_guard_new_transition3_2=*sigh* Sorry I was so short with you. Life is stressful when you're wandering around with your memories all screwed up.
IC_002_shaman_node0=Hi Gromov!
IC_002_shaman_node1=Don’t you remember anything?
IC_002_shaman_node2=You haven’t changed... Do you need any junk again?
IC_002_shaman_node3=He left with the tribe. We haven’t heard from them for a long time.
IC_002_shaman_node4=Northern lands *shows with her hand*
IC_002_shaman_transition0_1=*how did she learn my name?*
IC_002_shaman_transition1_1=*say nothing*
IC_002_shaman_transition2_1=Junk? What junk? No, I need your boss.
IC_002_shaman_transition3_1=Which way did they go?
IC_002_shaman_transition4_1=Thank you very much!
IC_002_treasure_node0=Halt! You there! Stay away from this chest! Leader's orders!
IC_002_treasure_node1=[salutes] Flenrik the Steady, accountant second class. Yes, I've been tasked with making an inventory of all the treasure we found. It's not glorious work, but it's still important! Why, just the other day I--
IC_002_treasure_node2=Oh, them? They went to frozen shard. Treasure isn't really the main goal of this expedition, if you catch my drift. Wink, wink. Secret stuff. I can't tell you. It's classified. So don't even ask, because I will never ever--
IC_002_treasure_transition0_1=Uh... hi. Don't worry, I wasn't going to take anything. Are you one of the expedition members?
IC_002_treasure_transition1_1=(Interrupt) Rrright. So, where did everybody else go?
IC_002_treasure_transition2_1=(Interrupt) Okay, thanks, bye!
IC_002_chest_guard_node0=Hey! I already told you! This chest belongs to the great Fox Brotherhood. I'm guarding it! If you steal some, my inventory is all messed up! I'm trying to to a good job here, and you're--
IC_002_chest_guard_transition0_1=(Interrupt) Oh, fine. *go away*
IC_002_chest_guard_transition0_2=(Interrupt) Put a cork in it, will ya? *attack the fox*
IC_002_fox_fire_node0=That should do it for the rats! But they set that fire, and our leader is trapped!
IC_002_fox_fire_transition0_1=Gotcha! I'm on it!
IC_002_guard_node0=Whew! That was getting hot! I'm sure lucky you happened along in your fireproof stone pants!
IC_002_guard_node1=Tracking ME? Ver-ry Interesting! Tell me more, Stone Pants.
IC_002_guard_node2="Home?" Ah, yes, the world your shard chipped off of, far away, long ago. Yes, yes. This idea has passed into legend for my people. Most are happy enough where they are, so they consider this to be just a story. But I know better. I know a way to this "home" you speak of. In happier times I would help you freely, Stone Pants. But these are not happy times for the Foxes.
IC_002_guard_node3=That is not important to us. The Forest Brotherhood has no need for victory or riches. We Foxes just wish to live in peace.
IC_002_guard_node4=The Rats that live in the forest with us SHOULD be able to coexist in peace. But they are greedy. They steal from us, they attack us. Stone Pants, they know nothing of cooperation! Even the Trolls will not attack us for no reason.
IC_002_guard_node5=Even now the Rats threaten us with a terrible secret weapon. I have a plan, but it requires an outsider. If you would help us, I can certainly help you find this "home" you speak of.
IC_002_guard_node6=I had a good feeling about you. Perhaps it was your excellent and practical clothing choices. Listen closely and I will tell you my plan.
IC_002_guard_transition0_1=Luck had nothing to do with it, sir. I've been tracking you for quite some time.
IC_002_guard_transition1_1=Uh, well, my name is actually... Never mind, Stone Pants is fine. Okay, so... I'm not from this world, and a friend told me that you might know a way to get home.
IC_002_guard_transition2_1=I know, you need treasure.
IC_002_guard_transition2_2=I know, you are at war with the Trolls.
IC_002_guard_transition2_3=Right, you and the Trolls have a common enemy.
IC_002_guard_transition2_4=Why not?
IC_002_guard_transition3_1=[continue]
IC_002_guard_transition4_1=[continue]
IC_002_guard_transition5_1=Excellent! I, Stone Pants, am your man!
IC_002_guard_transition5_2=Well.. If that's what it's going to take, then I guess so.
IC_002_guard_transition5_3=Side quests, shmide quests. I'm out of here.
085_start_node0=Psst! Get out of here, whoever you are! They're going to be back in just a second!
085_start_node1=I'm LUNCH, is what I am. Now get out of here unless you want to be dessert!
085_start_node2=Our expedition was meant to contact with the Trolls communicate with them. Some of us believe that they are intelligent and reasonable creatures, and that the Foxes and Trolls could form an alliance.
085_start_node3=Too late! They're coming back!! Get out of here! I can talk to them!
085_start_transition0_1=How did you get in there?
085_start_transition0_2=Who are you? Are you a member of the Fox Brotherhood?
085_start_transition1_1=What happened?
085_start_transition1_2=Where are the others?
085_start_transition2_1=How's that working out so far, Mr. Lunch?
085_start_transition2_2=Give me a second and I'll get you out of there. *start picking lock*
085_start_transition3_1=Maybe I can talk to them. I don't speak Troll, but maybe I can take a guess...?
085_start_transition3_2=Eh, I don't think that's worked very well for you so far, buddy. *crack knuckles and attack Trolls*
085_trolls_guards_node0=Goy lod nub dok
085_trolls_guards_transition0_1=...lod dok?
085_trolls_guards_transition0_2=Mmmm
085_finish_node0=Sigh...Thanks, I guess.
085_finish_node1=I'm Frendlis the Kind, chief diplomat. I just thought I could talk with these trolls and resolve things without violence. And without me being lunch. But their language is just so hard to learn. I need more time, and then I think the Foxes could have a great ally in the Troll Tribe.
085_finish_node2=Yeah, the expedition headed that way, further into the waterless lands. I'll stay here and try to make peace with the Trolls again.
085_finish_node3=No, thank you. I can handle it.
085_finish_node4=Now you know it. Try to learn their language somehow. They are good fellas.
085_finish_transition0_1=You GUESS?? What, should I just have let them eat you?
085_finish_transition0_2=Well, that's gratitude for you. So, are you the leader of this Expedition?
085_finish_transition1_1=Huh. Well, good luck with all that. Listen, I have to find your leader. Do you know where the rest of the expedition went?
085_finish_transition1_2=Is there any way I can help you with figuring out the Troll language?
085_finish_transition2_1=Well, you're welcome.*continue looking for expedition*
085_finish_transition3_1=I didn't knew that they are intellegent.
085_finish_transition3_2=As you wish. Are you going to help me or not?
085_finish_transition4_1=Thanks, Frendlis, See you soon!
104_start_node0=>gasp< A Creator!
104_start_node1=You are human, are you not? And your arm: mechanical! Created, like us! [begins talking to your mechanical arm] Arm, do you realize your good fortune? To be side by side with the brilliance and generosity of your Creator at all times, why, that is what we Created dream of our entire lives.
104_start_transition0_1=A what now? Creator? Me? Am I in the right place?
104_start_transition1_1=Huh. Well, it's really nice to meet you too.
104_finish_node0=You did it! We're receiving transmissions as we speak, and our knowledge of that area around the Citadel is increasing every second. What a grand moment this is in our history. I should have known a Creator of life such as you would rise to the challenge!
104_finish_node1=I will be sure to contact you as soon as I know anything useful. You've done us a great service, Creator. Please accept this medal as a token of our esteem. Show this to any Created you run into and he or she will help you without hesitation.
104_finish_transition0_1=No worries, L34D3R. I'm happy to do it, and I look forward to hearing more information about the Citadel.
104_finish_transition1_1=Thanks, L34D3R! I'll be back!
105_start_node0=Who is out there? >nnf< One moment. I'm trying to look at you, but my eyes' focus is stuck. [T1NK3R3R whirrs and clicks for a few seconds] Ah. Sorry. My mechanical body is hard to work, I'm afraid. Lots of knobs and switches.
105_start_node1=The robot parts suit me, don't they? I'll tell you, if I didn't have them, there wouldn't be much of me left. I was caught in a terrible explosion back in 2135, and it would have killed me if it weren't for these Created.
105_start_transition0_1=Are you-- partly human?
105_start_transition1_1=BACK in 2135? But that's almost 200 years in the future!
105_finish_node0=You're back! Wow, I still can't believe I can move around so easily. Thanks again for fixing my human-robot interface.
105_finish_node1=Fantastic! [deftly juggles the bits of meteorite in his hands] We'll get these installed right away. I bet we can give you some pretty great upgrades when this is all done.
105_finish_transition0_1=No problem. And here-- I got you some meteorite bars.
105_finish_transition1_1=Can't wait! Catch you later, TNK3R3R.
106_start_node0=Ah, Creator. My diodes warm to see you again. We are still waiting on the information from the probes that you so ably helped us send into space. Would you be interested in helping us with a small goal while we wait?
106_start_node1=Our Chief Engineer, T1NK3R3R, is studying gems that we think have their origins on the Citadel's shard. In any case, they hold great secrets. If you could assist him, it would mean the information coming back from the probes would be quite a bit more useful. How does that sound?
106_start_transition0_1=Sure.
106_start_transition1_1=Sounds great.
107_start_node0=Hey kid-- you have got to check this out. When we mounted the gems in the meteorite casings, you wouldn't believe the amount of energy it created. This is incredible. I don't know what we can do with it, but it provides a lot of energy that we could use for... something.
107_start_node1=A fine idea! I've already created a new kind of mechanical creature using these gems. The Crystal Scorpion. Here's the problem. Once I made it, it became too powerful and I can't turn it off. So I was wondering if you would defeat it, you know, in the name of science. And of saving our lives.
107_start_transition0_1=Well, could you build something new and test its limits?
107_start_transition1_1=Hold on. What if it's too powerful for me, as well?
107_finish_node0=Oh, hello! D-did you reconsider? Could I join you now? I'd love to help.
107_finish_node1=Truly, you are worthy!
107_finish_transition0_1=Oh, yes, sure, come along.
107_finish_transition1_1=Yes, thank you, I know.
108_start_node0=L34D3R was asking about you. He looked worried. I mean, even more than usual.
108_start_node1=Yes! Probes! "Probes", "disaster", "urgent" and even "the little man" - those are all the words that I understand.
108_start_transition0_1=He said something about the probes?
108_start_transition1_1=Thank you. We need to find L34D3R. It is an urgent matter.
109_start_node0=Ah, Creator, you're back. You've done so much for us. I hate to ask for anything more, but we've had a problem.
109_start_node1=The probes worked great, Creator. They sent back plenty of data, but what we need is physical samples from the probes themselves. The problem is that they didn't arrive where they were supposed to, and now they're on the wrong shards. We can track them, but they are in unexplored places. There could be quite a bit of danger. Are you willing to help our cause by tracking them down?
109_start_transition0_1=What is it?
109_start_transition1_1=This sounds like just my sort of thing. Let's go!
109_finish_node0=L34D3R: Ah, welcome, everyone. This is indeed an historic occasion, to have representatives of three major factions with us as we determine our future. I will introduce the participants, in case anyone has not met.  I am L34D3R, of the Created. This is Fentus the Red, of the Forest Brotherhood, and Lucifred, of the Forgers. We also have a very special observer who will act as a moderator for this meeting: Gromov the Goliath! His wisdom and experience in this world are legendary, and he has shown great sympathy toward all of our factions. It is my sincere hope that with him working with us, we can pull togehter and make a decision that will benefit all of us. Gromov, why don't you start us out?
109_finish_node1=L34D3R: Thank you, Gromov. Yes, the Created have had a long history on these shards, from our creation at the hands of human engineers, to our awakening to the true nature of reality, to our work together to create a shared knowledge base. We are the ones who thirst for knowledge on these shards, ever wishing to know what is beyond the next hill. Well, my friends, beyond the next hill this time is the Citadel. We know much about it, we have probed its secrets, but in order to breach the energy field, we need the Forest Brotherhood, and in order to have enough energy to transport there, we need the Forgers. We know what is needed. We know that the Citadel holds the secrets to clearing away the world's inequities and corruption, and creating a beautiful new world for all of us. We know the knowledge we need is contained on the Citadel, if only we can band together to get there!
109_finish_transition0_1=All right then. Hello everyone. Like L34D3R said, I hope we can all come to a conclusion that will work for all of the factions. I hope this because I have a desperate need to find my copilot and get back home. Okay. Now, we are going to hear from each of the leaders in turn, and then we will wrap this up. First, L34D3R, why don't you tell us of the Created's plan.
109_finish_transition1_1=Okay. Thank you, L34D3R. Now, Lucifred of the Forgers. What do you have to say about this?
110_start_node0=Traveler! Who you? What you want?
110_start_node1=[eyes widen] Ohh... you are here to see the King.
110_start_transition0_1=Oh, hello. I'm just following a signal I have. I... hmm, how to put this? I'm looking for a ...tool that fell from the sky.
110_start_transition1_1=The King? Uh...
110_ask_about_second_feat_node0=King! You succeed! Hooray! Me knew you could do it!
110_ask_about_second_feat_node1=Second task going to be no problem for you, king! Investigate why crops go missing for our tribe. Much danger! But beeping metal king always up for the task, I know!
110_ask_about_second_feat_transition0_1=[sigh] Yes, well, the king is glad you're so impressed.
110_ask_about_second_feat_transition1_1=Uh... right. Well, the king is happy to serve. I'm sure he'll do a great job.
110_king_valor_and_third_feat_node0=King! You do a great job! Very powerful! Very merciless!
110_king_valor_and_third_feat_node1=Yes. King must be powerful, but king also must be wise and kind. Here are two lovers who wish to be married. Because king so wise, and have so many experiences, he must perform marriage ceremony and give couple much good advice.
110_king_valor_and_third_feat_transition0_1=Listen, the uh...king is kind of tired of fighting right now. Is there anything else he could be doing?
110_king_valor_and_third_feat_transition1_1=That does sound quite a bit better.
110_finish_node0=Lovely friends, welcome here today! Big wedding time. Over here is Gonko, big in muscle, small in judgment! Over there is Klooka, fair in face, narrow in interests! Together they have big love! And great luck for all: the beeping metal king perform marriage ceremony! Beeping metal king, take it away!
110_finish_node1=Me do! Him not deserve her. Him a fool! She too good for him. Ah ha ha! I just kidding. Go on, Metal king.
110_finish_node2=Gonko says he do. I think he pretty lucky. Luckier than he deserve!
110_finish_transition0_1=Uh, right. Yes. Here we go. First, is there anyone who has any reason these two should not be married? Speak now or forever hold your--
110_finish_transition1_1=Ohh-kay. So. Gonko: do you take this woman to be your wife forever, and promise to ... uh, I dunno, make sure she's got enough food and clothes, and treat her right and so forth?
110_finish_transition2_1=Right. Okay. Klooka, do you take this man to be your husband and be nice to him and make sure he's got food and clothes? And hm... not tell other people he's a dummy, maybe?
111_start_node0=Gnark! Time out! Hey, human, why you interrupt our game? Our side about to win.
111_start_node1=Yes, "game," human. We play Kicking Round Thing Game. Our team is the Red Gnarks. Other team is the Blue Gnarks. WE HATE EACH OTHER! Anyway, we about to gnark them, so please stop interrupting and go to sidelines.
111_start_node2=No, you can't gnark the ball! How we gnark game without ball. So sick of everyone taking ball. I gnark you what: you can have ball if you pay us 10,000 gold. You got it? Gnark it over.
111_start_transition0_1=Oh, I'll just be a moment. I need to grab that beeping metal -- hold on, did you say "game"?
111_start_transition1_1=But-- your ball. I was wondering if I might borrow that just for ... uh... a while.
111_start_transition2_1=10,000 gold? Are you kid-- uh, gnarking me? Okay, forget it.
111_finish_node0=Ah, you gnarked it? How was monster?
111_finish_node1=HA HA! Take THAT, monster! He gnarked you good! Okay, here your beeping ball. Actually, it kind of getting annoying.
111_finish_transition0_1=Well, let's say he learned his lesson about wanting peace and quiet.
111_finish_transition1_1=Thanks!
111_money_or_fight_node0=So, you want this beeping ball, huh? Well, I gnark you got the money, because there no way we're giving it up.
111_money_or_fight_transition0_1="No way", huh? We'll see about that. [start cracking skulls]
111_money_or_fight_transition0_2=I got the money for your ball. Guess you'll be bored and rich now.
111_money_or_fight_transition0_3=What if I went and got your other balls from the monster, and taught it a little lesson about stealing?
111_money_or_fight_node1=Hmm. I like that idea! Yes, monster might gnark a good lesson. Never want peace and quiet! We give you the ball when you get back.
111_money_or_fight_transition1_1=Okay, back in a jiffy.
IC_002_guard_new_transition0_2=You're a real piece of work. Where the heck is your leader, fancy man?
IC_002_guard_transition6_1=...
085_trolls_guards_node1=Grruunk! Klab Gork gu lok ba Dunkle Bort!

085_trolls_guards_node7=Gok?
085_trolls_guards_node8=Gok?
085_trolls_guards_transition1_1=Uh...Dunkle Bort.
085_trolls_guards_transition1_2=Umm...Klab Gork.
085_trolls_guards_transition1_3=Yeah, Grunk!
085_trolls_guards_transition2_1=Hmm.. Frob Goy.
085_trolls_guards_transition2_2=Zub.
085_trolls_guards_transition2_3=Gok?
085_trolls_guards_transition3_1=Now we're talkin'! Nob Goy! Chob Chob Binko Bort!
085_trolls_guards_transition4_1=Thanks, Troll King! I think I got the hang of this! Framgog forever!
085_trolls_guards_transition5_1=...Zub?

085_trolls_guards_transition6_1=Whaa--? Uh... Flab! Uh... Dunkle Yog! Help!
085_trolls_guards_transition7_1=Gok?
085_trolls_guards_transition8_1=Grunk?
109_give_explorers_node0=You've done it, Creator! And have returned to us in one piece! This is cause for celebration! But alas, we have problems as well. The first is this: there is a protective field around the center of the world -- around the Citadel. Our probes can't make it through. They have gathered plenty of information, but if we are to get the true coordinates of the Citadel, we have to break through this field.
109_give_explorers_node1=Fantastic! Creator, you are truly wonderful. It is as I've always said: faith in the Creator will be rewarded. Now, our second problem. We Created are a clever bunch, but we tend to focus on elegance rather than sheer power. In that regard, we cannot even compete with the accursed Forgers, who accomplish their goals no matter the cost. I am sorry to admit that we require this power if we are going to the Citadel.
109_give_explorers_transition0_1=That problem I can solve. The Forest Brotherhood has seen that we're struggling with this, and has offered to perform a ritual on the probes so that they can make it through the field.
109_give_explorers_transition1_1=I have friends in the Forgers. Maybe I can convince them that this would be in their interest as well as yours and the Brotherhood's.
112_start_node0=Creator. I'm sorry the meeting went so poorly. What can I do for you?
112_start_node1=Oh. Creator, I... wish I could. Our information is collected and we all benefit from it, but the data is instantly transferred to a safer place. We have a central location where our highest ranking Created --our Elder Patriarchs -- may analyze the numbers and make the decisions. They are the ones that could release this information.
112_start_node2=I'm sorry. The Created Shard is classified. No outsiders are allowed. I wish I could help.
112_start_transition0_1=I've been trying for so long to help you, but I need to help myself as well. Everything I need is on the Citadel. I need to get there. If you would give me the coordinates, maybe I can figure out a way to get there myself. I would share with you anything I find out.
112_start_transition1_1=Maybe I can go and ask these elders for some help. Can you tell me where this location is? I could go there myself and work it out.
112_start_transition2_1=FOR THE LOVE OF -- Okay, fine.
112_dave_call_node0=It's Dave. How are you?
112_dave_call_node1=I'll try to learn more about this shard, just wait. And you need to learn the secrets of Forgers and Brotherhood.
112_dave_call_transition0_1=We need to reach a secret shard. The shard where Created keep their knowledge. This is the key to the Citadel.
112_dave_call_transition1_1=Okay, understood. I will get it done.
113_finish_node0=Hmm. It's you. It seems you've been doing quite a bit for the Forgers, Mr. Gromov. Funny that, since you seem to be more of a friend to the Created.
113_finish_node1=Huh. Well said. All right then, what can I do for you, Gromov?
113_finish_node2=By the best faction, no doubt, you mean us. Well, I can see that goal as being worthwhile. You are disruptive, no doubt about that. Without you in play, I see the Forgers' advantage being quite a bit bigger. Would the ability to make a teleporter and secretly travel to the Citadel help, young Gromov?
113_finish_transition0_1=Maybe so. But I think the Forgers have some good ideas about how to apply technology, and they don't let little matters of ethics hold them back.
113_finish_transition1_1=I am sympathetic to the Forgers, but I have my own goals. I need to get to the Citadel. I have a friend there, and getting there is my only way home. What I wish to do is leave this world and take my disruptive actions with me, leaving the Forgers, the Brotherhood, and the Created to duke it out among themselves, letting the best faction win.
113_finish_transition2_1=It would. I would be very interested in having such a thing.
086_start_node0=Whew! That was getting hot! I'm sure lucky you happened along in your fireproof stone pants! How did you find me, Stone Pants?
086_start_node1="Home?" Ah, yes, the world your shard chipped off of, far away, long ago. Yes, yes. This idea has passed into legend for my people. Most are happy enough where they are, so they consider this to be just a story. But I know better. I know a way to this "home" you speak of. In happier times I would help you freely, Stone Pants. But these are not happy times for the Foxes.
086_start_node2=The Rats claim to have a terrible weapon capable of wiping out the entire Forest Brotherhood in an instant, Stone Pants. They call it... "The Double Orbiter". We know nothing about it at all, except where it is kept: a locked black chest deep within the Rats' compound. And someone who seems to be an ally to the Rats -- like you -- might be able to get inside and find out just what they are planning.
086_start_node3=The Forest Brotherhood and the Vermafia are lifelong enemies, and we each know much about the other. This beautiful amulet I wear is one-of-a-kind and signifies that I am Leader of the Brotherhood. If you bring it to them and say that you have killed me in single combat, they will recognize it and may believe you.
086_start_node4=Er... all right. That doesn't make a lot of sense, but I guess you have your reasons.
086_start_transition0_1=Uh, well, my name is actually... Never mind, Stone Pants is fine. Okay, so... I'm not from this world, and a friend told me that you might know a way to get home.
086_start_transition1_1=Why not?
086_start_transition2_1=I see! Cloak and dagger type stuff. I like it. But I'm just another stranger to them. Why would they let me in?
086_start_transition3_1=All right, I'll do it! Grr! Lie! Steal! Insult! Look out, Rats, here I come!
086_start_transition3_2=Forget it, Fox Boss. I can't lie. I'm just too good of a person to help you save your people, I guess.
086_start_transition4_1=I do what I want! *fist pump*
086_finish_node0=Stone Pants! You've returned from your undercover assignment with those foul, dishonorable Rats! Could you do it? Could you pretend to be a soulless mercenary and win their trust?
086_finish_node1=So: the weapon! Could you discover the design of the Double Orbiter so that our engineers can learn how to disarm it??
086_finish_node2=What? Stone Pants, do you tell me true? Oh, I am a fool, such a fool! How can the Forest Brotherhood look to me as a leader if I cannot see through such a transparent ruse?
086_finish_node3=Really! Okay, Stone Pants, please do this mission for us. We will give you what you ask for, just please destroy the Double Orbiter and bring peace to the Forest Brotherhood!
086_finish_node4=Stone Pants, you are a great ally. You have the Forest Brotherhood's great admiration and my personal loyalty until the end of time.
086_finish_transition0_1=Actually, yes, and I'm exhausted by it. Every single rat told me he was the supreme leader of the entire group. It'll be a great relief to work with honest folk from now on.
086_finish_transition1_1=Yes, as a matter of fact, it's quite a simple design. It doesn't exist. They have been using your fear to control you.
086_finish_transition1_2=Uh... yeees. It's very dangerous, but if you give me 1000 gold, I will sneak in and destroy it for you.
086_finish_transition2_1=You care deeply about the well-being of all of your subjects. You are the leader they deserve. I'm proud to work with you.
086_finish_transition3_1=*laughs* Sorry, I was just kidding. There's no weapon. They played you for a sucker.
086_finish_transition3_2=Well, thanks! I'll let you know when it's destroyed. Nice to deal with folks who are so honest (and stupid).
086_finish_transition4_1=Thanks! I humbly accept. I look forward to working with you, Fentus.
072_start_node0=Ah, you must be the human that Skree the Sentry said was going to help us.
072_start_node1=Well, we've got a rat missing. Skrask the Unreliable. I never liked him. He's a liar and a weasel. That's worse than a rat. But he owes me four seeds and he borrowed my fur-comb, and I think he's found some treasure, so I want you to find him.
072_start_node2=Hmm. You seem extremely eager. That's sort of ...suspicious. Well, anyway...
072_start_node3=Are you going to ask that every time? You're proving yourself to the Rats. We're the most powerful group in the forest. With our help you'll be invincible. That's what's in it for you. Sheesh. Anyway, I like your attitude.
072_start_node4=Lemme see your map. Here's where he was last seen. It's an old abandoned military base from long ago and far away. Maybe it was your people who designed it. If so, you guys have a lot of good stuff to steal. Find him, alive or dead, it doesn't matter.
072_start_node5=He said HE'S the leader? What a joke. He's just a sentry that likes to talk big. Truth is... Actually, I'M the leader. Yeah. I'm just hanging out here, selling junk in a junk shop to uh... keep my eye on the comings and goings of these other rats.
072_start_transition0_1=(grunt) Maybe I am. Whaddya got?
072_start_transition0_2=Skree said he was the leader.
072_start_transition0_3=NOPE I CAN'T HANDLE THIS SORRY SEE YA!!
072_start_transition1_1=(narrow eyes) What's in it for me?
072_start_transition1_2=Okey dokey, I'm on it! Where do I go?
072_start_transition1_3=NEVER MIND I CAN'T DO IT BYE!
072_start_transition2_1=[continue]
072_start_transition3_1=[continue]
072_start_transition4_1=(shrug, spit on ground) Eh, sure, why not?
072_start_transition4_2=Okey doke!
072_start_transition4_3=I CHANGED MY MIND THIS IS TOO STRESSFUL BYE!!
072_start_transition5_1=(shrug) Whatever you say.
072_lost_stalker_node0=Unnngh... Who's out there? I'm so thirsty and I can't move. My...my arm is trapped.
072_lost_stalker_node1=Friends? Nah, that can't be right. Probably old Skubs the Junk Dealer. He's jealous of me and always wants to know where I am on account of uh... the fact that I'm the Supreme Leader of the Vermafia. I'm just out here because I can't trust any of my underlings to do anything right. Anyway...
072_lost_stalker_node2=I was exploring this ruin and found some great loot. But everything is just falling apart. So I'm stuck here.
072_lost_stalker_node3=I think we could clear it off me if we used a bomb. And I have one! I can give it to you through this crack. Try to blow up this stones! But don't kill me!
072_lost_stalker_transition0_1=Are you Skrask the Unreliable? I was sent to find you by one of your friends.
072_lost_stalker_transition0_2=(look unsympathetically at trapped rat) Looks like you've had a lousy day. How'd you get into this mess?
072_lost_stalker_transition1_1=[continue]
072_lost_stalker_transition2_1=[continue]
072_lost_stalker_transition3_1=(even more dismissive snort) What a stupid idea.
072_lost_stalker_transition3_2=I can handle it.
072_stone_dam_node0=[There is a massive pileup of stones. Skrask the Unreliable has an arm trapped under it, but otherwise appears to be uninjured. There are several pockets where you could place some sort of explosive device without risking killing the rat.]
072_stone_dam_node1=*after some time, and some bloody fingers, it dawns on you that there are too many stones.You need to get rid of the blockage some other way*
072_stone_dam_transition0_1=*put the mine between the stones and blow the passage*
072_stone_dam_transition0_2=*start clearing the blockage with your hands*
072_stone_dam_transition0_3=*leave empty-handed*
072_stone_dam_transition1_1=Ouch. Looks like I need something big -- and explodey -- to blast this apart.
072_finish_node0=Skubs the Junk Dealer: So... it looks like you freed Skrask the Unreliable. As the Leader of all the Rats, I salute you. As an undercover junk dealer, I am angry. He hasn't brought me back any of his loot, or any of the stuff he borrowed from me. In fact, he said you stole it from him.
072_finish_node1=Hrmph. Well, that's uh... obviously not true. Okay, fine. You have completed my task. This I decree as undisputed leader of the Vermafia.
072_finish_transition0_1=He also said he was he Leader of the Rats and that you were just jealous. So maybe that's true too?
072_finish_transition1_1=Okay, then, boss. Got anything else for me?
071_start_node0=Halt, intruder! Hmm... a human, is it? HISS!! What is your business here, at the Rat Nest?
071_start_node1=Eh? Well, I... Er, listen, I'll let you in on a little secret. I AM the boss, I'm just doing some checking up on all of the other rats. Making sure they're not stealing my stuff or making deals with the enemy. So yeah. That's me, the boss. Whadda you got?
071_start_node2=WHOA! You killed the leader of-- Uh, I mean, big deal. He wasn't really that tough or smart or noble or anything. Anyone could do it.
071_start_node3=HUH? What do you know about the Double Orbiter? Do you know that it's -- Uh, ahem, I mean... that all depends. You're going to have to prove to us your loyalty if you want help from the Rats. We have three quests that need to be undertaken. They're super easy and not dangerous. I'd do them myself but I have to guard this post. Uh, by choice. Because I'm the leader.
071_start_node4=So eager! Almost like you've got some kind of trick up your sleeve. Well, anyway...
071_start_node5=You know what's in it for you. The final destruction of the Foxes and the eternal gratitude and loyalty of the Rats. That there is worth its weight in gold.
071_start_node6=Okay, so first thing you have to do is come in and find Skubs the Junk Dealer. He's got a uh... SUPER EASY and NOT AT ALL DANGEROUS mission for you to do.
071_start_node7=How dare you not trust me! You've hurt my feelings. Come back when you can treat me with some basic human (and rat) kindness.
071_start_transition0_1=Ahem. What's it to you, sentry? I don't talk with underlings; I want the Big Boss. He and I have big things to discuss.
071_start_transition0_2=Uhhh...NOTHING! I just remembered I have something to do somewhere else. With somebody else!! BYE!
071_start_transition1_1=All right, seems plausible. Here's the thing, Big Boss. I know you have a problem with the Foxes. I had a problem with them too, until I KILLED their leader! *show Rat the amulet*
071_start_transition1_2=A likely story. Get me the real leader.
071_start_transition2_1=Well, anyone didn't do it. I did. And I want to make a deal. We can wipe out the Foxes together, if we can power up your weapon: the Double Orbiter.
071_start_transition3_1=All right, what do you got?
071_start_transition3_2=(eye him suspiciously) I don't know. What's in it for me?
071_start_transition3_3=Never mind, I'll take that amulet back! I gotta go, BYE!!
071_start_transition4_1=[continue]
071_start_transition5_1=[continue]
071_start_transition6_1=(narrow eyes and curl lip contemptuously) Fine.
071_start_transition6_2=NEVER MIND I GOTTA GO!
071_start_transition7_1=Uh...okay.
071_finish_node0=You there. I hear you've been doing a lot of missions around here for... uh, my underlings.
071_finish_node1=Yeah, you're right! Looks like you have a keen eye, to be able to pick out my leadership qualities while I'm working undercover as a bum just sitting next to a chest.
071_finish_node2=Yeah, I heard that you've been really helpful, and earned our trust. Sure, human, take a look.
071_finish_node3=[there is nothing inside the chest except a small note that says "Fooled you".
071_finish_node4=Ah-ha! Yeah, we rats aren't so great at engineering anything, but we're terrific at lying. We've had those foxes wrapped around our fingers from day one. What a bunch of chumps!
071_finish_node5=ME NEITHER! What a great trick that was. Man, I could live to be a hundred and I'll never come up with one like that again.
071_finish_transition0_1=Underlings, huh? I guess that would make you the Supreme Leader of the Vermafia.
071_finish_transition1_1=Well, I have a question, Mr. Boss. That chest you're standing next to is supposed to contain the Double Orbiter, the ultimate weapon against the Foxes of the Forest Brotherhood. Can I check it out?
071_finish_transition2_1=[open chest]
071_finish_transition3_1=What the heck is this?
071_finish_transition4_1=So you just threatened them with a non-existent weapon and they just did what you wanted? I can't believe that worked.
071_finish_transition5_1=Naturally it was your idea; you're the leader. Nice work. Well, I'm off.
073_start_node0=We've had a crash of some sort of Human Transport over in the snowy area. Humans have the best junk, and they never seem to know what to do with it. Except for you, of course. One look at your robotic suit shows you have a great familiarity with garbage.
073_start_node1=I would particularly like any orange chips you would find in the wreckage. We don't know what they do, but whatever: they make nice jewelry. My wife and daughter want them, and I get them whatever they want, or else they make my life miserable.
073_start_transition0_1=Er...thanks?
073_start_transition1_1=[snarl] I begrudgingly accept.
073_finish_node0=Skubs the Junk Dealer: You're back? You got the chips? But how were you not killed by creatures or traps on the... Uhh, best not to dwell on things which did not happen.
073_finish_node1=Me? No, nothing, nothing at all! Nice work! You appear to be quite resourceful and dangerous. In fact, you're making me a little nervous. Thanks for doing the quest - now move along.
073_finish_transition0_1=Wait a second. I thought these missions were supposed to be EASY and NOT AT ALL DANGEROUS. What are you trying to pull?
073_finish_transition1_1=[snort, look mean] That's right, I'm tougher than tough.
080_start_node0=Sklisk the Vivisector: Well hello there, you must be the hu-man who is so intelligent and crafty that he can do what the rats cannot. Very interesting! If you have the belly for it, I have a job for you.
080_start_node1=Well, shall we say, human, that there are sometimes things -- scientifically speaking -- that must be done, but not everyone thinks that the lengths we must go to are justified. They say it's too cruel. But I look at you: a hard look to your eye, a hard heart in your chest, and I know you are the one to help me.
080_start_node2=Sure, sure. I can say that with absolute unquestionable certainty because >ahem< I am the supreme leader of the Vermafia. I just like to work anonymously in my lab. It relaxes me. Anyway, we're working on a serum to give the rats great strength in battle. Forbidden Strength! And the source of all this strength? Snow leopards. Specifically, their hearts.
080_start_node3=Yep. Kill 'em, chop out their hearts, stick 'em in a sack and bring 'em back to me, dripping and bloody. You in or out, human?
080_start_transition0_1=The belly for it? What kind of job is this?
080_start_transition1_1=Er, right. Grr. Snarl. That's me. So if I do this I earn the respect of the Rats, right?
080_start_transition2_1=Their ...hearts?
080_start_transition3_1=Uuuhhgghghh. That sounds disgusting, but I'll do it to fool y-- I mean, to earn your trust.
080_finish_node0=Ahh, human, you are back. Do you have all the hearts? Bloody and disgusting?
080_finish_node1=Ye-es, so they are. Very disgusting! These will work nicely for the serum, my hard-hearted human friend. I know you must have enjoyed this on some level.
080_finish_transition0_1=>sigh< Yes, here they’re.
080_finish_transition1_1=Ugh. I mean, oh, yes. Grr. Kill. Murder. That's me.
081_start_node0=Human! You are back. Excellent. We have finished the strength serum, and now we are testing it.
081_start_node1=Well, human, obviously we have to test it on stupid creatures who have no sense of pain and have no personality of their own. And because humans are scarce, we use trolls. So now we have a troll who is doped to the gills on our snow leopard serum, and he is so strong that we can't handle him. We need him alive, but can you get in your armor and knock the fight out of him?
081_start_transition0_1=Oh, right! That makes sense. You want to make sure it's safe, so you first test it on some lab raaaa-- uhhhh, heh heh. Never mind. So what do you do?
081_start_transition1_1=Uh... okay. Because as you know, I am merciless and tough. >sigh< So I guess I'll go beat on this poor troll.
081_start_transition1_2=Uphh. I changed my mind! Bye!
081_finish_node0=Ex-cellent! Even though you destroyed our test troll, we have gotten a great deal of scientific knowledge out of watching the battle. And of course, I know you enjoyed bashing him around.
081_finish_node1=Hmm. Sounds as if your heart is not in it, human. Never mind, I must just be imagining things. You have accomplished much with the Rats-- I mean, my subjects. Well done.
081_finish_transition0_1=>sigh< Oh, yes, I just can't get enough of hurting other creatures.
081_finish_transition1_1=Okay, thanks. I guess I'm off to do something else terrible.
082_start_node0=Ho there, Armored Warrior! I'm also the leader of a small group of rats who are--- >ahem< Sorry, I misspoke. I am the leader of ALL of the Rats, here and everywhere. Anyway, one of my many, many responsibilities is a small group of scouts who have ventured into the desert and lost contact. I need you to find them. Can you do it, Armored Warrior?
082_start_node1=Doesn't look that way, son, but don't be sad! Maybe something will come up!
082_start_transition0_1=Sounds better than some of the other ones. I don't have to kill anyone, do I?
082_start_transition1_1=Sure, okay.
082_finish_node0=Ah, good, good! Never leave a man behind, that's our motto, unless he's already served his purpose or takes up too many resources. You've brought back my loyal scouts. I, the leader of all the Rats, salute you.
082_finish_node1=Ah, then you've brought back a sorry group of traitors. Nevertheless, you have proven yourselves to the Rats, and as Supreme Leader, I grant you full access! You may move about our encampment without restriction. And if any other rat claims to be leader, well... just play along.
082_finish_transition0_1=Thanks! Oh, and one of them claims that HE is the leader of all the rats.
082_finish_transition1_1=Thanks!
083_start_node0=I-- I can't believe it! It must be a mirage! Those ungrateful slobs back at headquarters actually sent someone to find us! I can't believe they even bothered to care about us lowly scou-- Er, I mean me, the supreme leader of all the Rats.
083_start_node1=Look, we could argue all day about who's the leader of who, but we're dying of thirst out here, and we're being attacked by Gnarks. You probably saw a couple of those filthy beasts on the way out. So listen. We're exhausted and can't move, but if you could fill our canteens at the oasis, we'd recover. Hurry, human!
083_start_transition0_1=Hmm. Your BOSS sent me to find you, Mr. "Supreme Leader".
083_start_transition1_1=Gotcha, "Boss". Back in a flash.
083_finish_node0=>wheeze< THERE he is! What took you so long? Are you trying to torture me?
083_finish_node1=*gulping water* Ahhh. I see now that being dehydrated made me a little testy with you. I deeply apologize.
083_finish_node2=As Supreme Leader, I take back your sentence of being burned at the stake. You are a free man now.
083_finish_transition0_1=Here you go, and you're welcome.
083_finish_transition1_1=Well, that's okay, I--
083_finish_transition2_1=Thanks a bunch.
084_start_node0=Okay, now that we've had a drink, we should be ready to go! Hup hup! *groans, falls over* Ooohh, I was wrong. I feel terrible still. Why must this happen to the wise and powerful leader of all the rats?! Why, cruel hand of fate, WHY??
084_start_node1=You have saved our lives. We are in your debt. Truly, you might even receive an extra bowl of gruel at mealtime tonight.
084_start_transition0_1=Okay. Climb in.
084_start_transition1_1=I take that as a great compliment.
084_finish_node0=The Supreme Leader lives to lead again! Due to my shrewd wisdom and unflagging determination, we have made it out of danger. Also had a tiny bit of help from (mumble, mumble) this guy over here.
084_finish_transition0_1=No problem, friend.
074_start_node0=Well, well, well! So this is the hu-man, is it? He don't look so tough, do he, boys? >hic< I hear you been asking around for stuff to do. Heck, we got work for ya if you think you can handle it, ya soft-skin baby-face!
074_start_node1=Ohhh! Well, ain't he something! Okay, tough guy, put away your dainty little teacups, because this here's a DRINKIN' CONTEST. You got to drink our special home-made brew, then you got to out-battle our TWO toughest fighters. You think you can hold your own, kid?
074_start_transition0_1=I can handle whatever you dish out, Rats. I'm as tough as they come.
074_start_transition1_1=[crack knuckles] Personally, I'm parched. Let's get this started.
074_finish_node0=You’re not so weak as you might seem to at first sight.
074_finish_node1=In any case, you were good! Want another job?
074_finish_transition0_1=Aha... I train hard when nobody sees me. What’s more, I have giant robots.
074_finish_transition1_1=Why not?
075_start_node0=Well, you're as tough as you say, it seems. Listen, human, maybe we can use you. We have a plantation where we grow all the crops we need for our secret brew, but some critter keeps wrecking the place, stealin' supplies, and stomping plants.
075_start_node1=Yeah, we thought about it long and hard and really examined the evidence. Our best guess is some kind of giant drunk monster. The guard over at the plantation will know more, but I stand by our extremely edjamacated guess.
075_start_transition0_1=Who do you think it is? Got any suspects?
075_start_transition1_1=Drunk Monster. Okay. This is worth checking out just to prove you wrong.
075_finish_node0=Well, whoopty do. You're back. Did ya solve our theft problem?
075_finish_node1=Nice work. You may make a good enforcer yet.
075_finish_node2=Not a bad idea. I got a cousin who's looking for work. He drinks a bit too much, but that shouldn't be a problem, right?
075_finish_transition0_1=You bet. I bested the beast in single combat and tore these horns right off his head. He cried like a little baby. >grunt<
075_finish_transition0_2=You may want to get a new guard. I think he's a bit on the unreliable side.
075_finish_transition0_3=You may want to get a new guard. I think he's a bit on the DEAD side.
075_finish_transition1_1=Thanks. Got anything else for me?
075_finish_transition2_1=Uh, sure. Anyway, let me know if there's anything else I can do.
076_start_node0=I handle this plantation. What are you doing here? Who are you?
076_start_node1=Aha! Exactly! We have a thief here, and he or she steals berries at nights. Talk to the guard, he knows the details.
076_start_transition0_1=I'm Gromov. Head of Bootleggers sent me to deal with your problems.
076_start_transition1_1=OK
076_plantation_guard_node0=You there! Halt! Stay right--OHHH my head! Please, just go somewhere else. I'm guarding this plantation but I feel awful. So just please leave and bother someone else. I've got enough problems.
076_plantation_guard_node1=Uh huh! Yeah, and if that weren't enough, I got my bosses all over my case because there's a GIANT DRUNK MONSTER WITH GLOWING HORNS that comes and wrecks this place every night!
076_plantation_guard_node2=Well, I didn't really see it. Uh, I uh, was kind of asleep when it showed up. Y'see, sometimes my head hurts a lot like it does right now, and I, heh, y'know, just need a little sip of the good stuff to make it go away.
076_plantation_guard_node3=Maybe it was! What's it to you, human? I got a lousy job. I'm allowed a little something to keep the cold out.
076_plantation_guard_node4=Well, I'll let you in on a little secret. I'm actually the leader of all the Rats. I just do this job because of all the perks, like staying up all night and doing a little drinking.
076_plantation_guard_node5=Whoa, how'd you know?
076_plantation_guard_transition0_1=What's the matter? Are you sick?
076_plantation_guard_transition0_2=Oh yeah? Let me guess, you're also the leader of all the Rats.
076_plantation_guard_transition1_1=Huh. You don't say. Did you see it?
076_plantation_guard_transition1_2=Sounds like you're not doing such a great job of guarding.
076_plantation_guard_transition2_1=It's got to be more of a sip if it's putting you to sleep.
076_plantation_guard_transition2_2=Sounds like your bosses might have a good reason to be irritated with you.
076_plantation_guard_transition3_1=Okay, well, your bosses sent me to investigate, so I'll start looking around for this GIANT DRUNK MONSTER WITH GLOWING HORNS.
076_plantation_guard_transition4_1=Sounds a lot more like "doing a little drinking" than "staying up all night."
076_plantation_guard_transition5_1=Just a guess. And hey, maybe it's the stress of leadership is making you feel terrible.
076_dungeon_attack_node0=Go away! Or I’ll kill you!
076_dungeon_attack_node1=As you were!
076_dungeon_attack_transition0_1=Try me.
076_dungeon_attack_transition1_1=*get ready to fight*
076_under_door_node0=*Your path is blocked by a sturdy wooden door*
076_under_door_node1=*Nope.*
076_under_door_transition0_1=*kick it as hard as you can*
076_under_door_transition0_2=*use the key*
076_under_door_transition0_3=*leave empty-handed*
076_under_door_transition1_1=Ouch, my foot. That door is too hard. I need a key.
076_dungeon_attack2_node0=[While looking around, you find a crammed into a crack in the rock] "Hey stupid, if you're too drunk to remember where you put the stupid key, I'll give you a stupid hint. It's in one of these stupid chests. Love, Stupid."
076_dungeon_attack2_transition0_1=That's... an interesting note. Okay, thanks, Mr. Stupid.
076_retkin_thief_node0=[You enter the room. The first thing you see are the glowing horns and a bunch of empty bottles. You hear a noise behind you, and it is the guard you spoke to earlier.] Guard: S-so you found it.
076_retkin_thief_node1=L-listen. I just GOTTA have those drinks every night, or else I get so sick I can't do my job. A-and I needed a cover story, so that my bosses -- I-I mean wait, I'm the leader... Oh, never mind -- so that my bosses wouldn't get mad. So wait, maybe we can make a deal. I'm going to stop, I swear, so why don't you take these horns back and tell them you killed the monster. Right? No harm done.
076_retkin_thief_node2=N-no, I will! Uh, wait, maybe I can give you some of the money. Did I tell you I also, um, accidentally stole some money?
076_retkin_thief_node3=Wh-what? No! You can't do that! I'll lose my livelihood! What am I supposed to do? You're a monster! How dare you??
076_retkin_thief_node4=>sniff< Maybe. I dunno. I'm NOT smart, I'm stupid. I even have to leave myself notes because I'm so stupid that I forget things. The only thing I've ever been good at was making up little stories like the DRUNK MONSTER WITH GLOWING HORNS and that... say, that wouldn't be such a bad job. Thanks, human, I'll do that!
076_retkin_thief_transition0_1=What? YOU'RE the one behind all the stealing?
076_retkin_thief_transition1_1=I don't know about this. I don't think you're really going to quit.
076_retkin_thief_transition1_2=Seems like I should just tell them the truth and then they can hire someone who will do their job properly.
076_retkin_thief_transition2_1=>sigh< All right, fork it over. And the horns. I'll tell them your little cover story.
076_retkin_thief_transition3_1=Not my problem, pal. [fight]
076_retkin_thief_transition3_2=Hold on a minute. Is this really what you want? Don't you think a smart guy like you could do better than stealing from his work and staying drunk all the time?
076_retkin_thief_transition4_1=Well, no problem. Good luck!
076_finish_node0=Amazing! How fast you solved our problem!
076_finish_node1=Take the reward, friend. Come to visit us. Maybe I’ll have other job for you. You’re always welcome here.
076_finish_transition0_1=It’s nothing but deduction.
076_finish_transition1_1=OK! I’ll pay a visit later.
077_start_node0=I got one last thing for ya. I'll let you in on a little secret. I'm actually the Supreme Leader of all the Rats. That means I got some high-level trading going on with some very secret types. Types you don't even want to know about.
077_start_node1=What? No! There are no other-- Listen, don't get smart with me, robot-man. These secret types need a secret potion for their secret activities. Now, we Rats are pretty good at making regular hooch, but the fancy stuff? We leave to the stupid fancy foxes. There's a shaman out a ways in the woods. Go talk to her and get the goods. You want to be in good with us Rats, right?
077_start_transition0_1=Okay. Are they the OTHER Supreme Leaders of the Rats?
077_start_transition1_1=Yep. All right, I'm on it.
077_fox_simple_node0=What do you want?
077_fox_simple_node1=No, I was going to be an accountant, you know... I don’t know anything about potions... But I know one shaman. Go and see her.
077_fox_simple_node2=You know what... If you need any help with any calculations, let me know.
077_fox_simple_transition0_1=I need the recipe of the trance potion. Have you heard of it?
077_fox_simple_transition1_1=Thanks!
077_fox_simple_transition2_1=I will!
077_finish_node0=Oh, well, here he comes again, crawling back. Did ya get the trance potions for our super secret clients who need them for super secret mystical enchantments?
077_finish_node1=All right! Trance potions all around. Bottoms up! Let's get TRANCED!
077_finish_transition0_1=Yeah, I got 'em.
077_finish_transition1_1=Um. So... I guess we're done here.
078_start_node0=[The fox is in a trance]
078_start_node1=>Snrrk?< Wh-whazzat? Oh. Yeah, I'm a shaman. So what's the deal? I was doing important work on the astral plane, man.
078_start_node2=Friends, huh? Cool, cool. I think I know who you're talking about. Well, I don't deal in money, man. That's just a false system! What I need is a favor, instead. You okay with that?
078_start_node3=Cool, cool. No big deal, friend. It's just that I've got, like all these cocoons lying around that are, like, making it really hard to meditate, man. It's kind of a mess. Can you smash 'em, and like, clean that up?
078_start_transition0_1=Uh... excuse me? I'm looking for a shaman around here. Hello? Are you awake?
078_start_transition1_1=Oh, uh, sorry. I'm kind of in a rush, and I was wondering if I might be able to buy some trance potions from you. They're for some friends.
078_start_transition2_1=Sure, I guess. Like I said, I'm in a hurry.
078_start_transition3_1=I guess. Okay, I'll be right back. Like I said, I'm in a rush. Money would be a lot easier!
078_finish_node0=Whoa, thanks, man. That looks a lot better now. Much cleaner. Cool. I'm sure that whatever was metamorphosizing in there is, like, in a better place now, man.
078_finish_node1=Oh, yeah, well, sure, man, just maybe do one more thing. Like, my connection to the spirits has been a little shaky lately. Like a bad mystical connection, does that make sense?
078_finish_node2=No, man, my problem is purely mystical. Like, the motes of pure thought energy are, like, swirling at the wrong resonance, y'know? The pure light of love and harmony can't get through.
078_finish_transition0_1=Super. Can I get those trance potions? Like I said, I'm sort of in a hurry.
078_finish_transition1_1=Uh, yeah, actually, it does. I've got the same problem with my friend on the radio. Is yours because of the shards orbiting around at different speeds too?
078_finish_transition2_1=Yikes. Uh, okay.
079_start_node0=There's a stupid golem who keeps wrecking my mystical receiver. Can ya go kill it and bring me back its heart?
079_start_transition0_1=Okay.
079_finish_node0=*wakes up from trance, opens one eye* Oh wow, man, you're back! Did you accomplish your mission, and bring peace and harmony to the spirit world?
079_finish_node1=Oh, yeah, right, I got my missions mixed up. Yeah, hand over that heart, man. Oh, and here are your trance potions.
079_finish_node2=One more thing, man. Sounds to me like your reception problem might be bigger than just the orbit of the shards, y'know? Maybe you made this friend mad at some point. I dunno, just somethin' to think about, man.
079_finish_transition0_1=No, is that what you wanted me to do? I killed a golem and brought you its heart.
079_finish_transition1_1=Okay, thanks. [wipe golem blood off hands]
079_finish_transition2_1=Uh, okay, I'll consider that.
101_start_node2=W-well, I didn't think you'd get mad about it. This seems like a good trade to me. I-I had some knowledge that you didn't have, and we traded a little. That's fair. Isn't it?
101_start_node3=Oh, well, wonderful!! We hope you can help us again sometime.
101_start_transition2_1=Nnnff. >sigh< I guess so. Thanks for your help. I see your side of it.
101_start_transition2_2=You must be out of your mind, Fox man. You and all your followers can go jump in a lake.
101_start_transition3_1=Heh. Yeah, I guess. Boy, the things I do to avoid an argument...
087_start_node2=Brave AND foolish! Why, you may be more useful to me than I thought! Follow the directions I have given you to the Caves of Infinite Terror, bring me the stone, and I have much forbidden knowledge to impart to you.
087_start_transition2_1=The Caves of...? Oh great. Okay, see you later if I'm still alive.
087_finish_node2=Ah, thank you, Gromov. Come back any time.
087_finish_transition1_2=Uh...nothing. Nope. Here's the stone. Don't worry about taking any precautions with it.
087_finish_transition2_1=Уou're welcome.
089_start_transition4_2=Ah, never mind, we're good. What should I do?
091_start_node4=>ding< It is yours for 1000 gold. I need the money to retire to a nice cozy metal box somewhere.
091_start_node5=>ding ding< Excellent. Here is the translator. It will require many interactions with the creatures in order to build its vocabulary. I wish you luck. You will need it with Lucifred.
091_start_node6=>bzzt bzzt< Then the price is reduced. 700 gold and it is yours.
091_start_transition3_2=That sounds good, but I already have a Troll language dictionary.
091_start_transition4_1=That sounds good. Let's do it!
091_start_transition4_2=I'm a little short on funds. I'll be back when I get some more money.
091_start_transition5_1=All right. Happy retirement.
091_start_transition6_1=Deal.
091_start_transition6_2=I'm a little short on funds. I'll be back when I get some more money.
093_start_transition0_2=Hmm, how do I get them to talk? [Leave golems alone]
094_start_node2=[troll all nod, make terrifying faces at you, and point at the lair]
094_start_node3=[troll cheers wildly and points at the lair]
094_start_transition0_2=Foz Yog?
094_start_transition0_3=KROB LA!
094_start_transition2_1=...I'm lost. I'll see you after I come out of this lair, I guess.
094_start_transition3_1=I don't know what this means! KROB LA!!
094_troll_kill_south_node2=[troll cheers]
094_troll_kill_south_node3=[troll offers you a hug]
094_troll_kill_south_transition0_2=Krob la Foz Yog! [Smash the Wild Monsters!]
094_troll_kill_south_transition0_3=Dunkle Bort. [Troll Ally]
094_troll_kill_south_transition2_1=YEAH! TROLLS!
094_troll_kill_south_transition3_1=Awww... Trolls.
094_troll_kill_north_node2=[troll cheers]
094_troll_kill_north_node3=[troll offers you a hug]
094_troll_kill_north_transition0_2=Krob la Foz Yog! [Smash the Wild Monsters!]
094_troll_kill_north_transition0_3=Dunkle Bort. [Troll Ally]
094_troll_kill_north_transition2_1=YEAH! TROLLS!
094_troll_kill_north_transition3_1=Awww... Trolls.
094_troll_kill_east_node2=[troll cheers]
094_troll_kill_east_node3=[troll offers you a hug]
094_troll_kill_east_transition0_2=Krob la Foz Yog! [Smash the Wild Monsters!]
094_troll_kill_east_transition0_3=Dunkle Bort. [Troll Ally]
094_troll_kill_east_transition2_1=YEAH! TROLLS!
094_troll_kill_east_transition3_1=Awww... Trolls.
095_start_transition0_2=Gee, you know, I've been meaning to learn it for a while, but I've just been so busy helping everyone out...
095_troll_guard_1_node2=When him take bars, yes, him smell like motor oil. Not smell like anymore. Him tricksy! Him others still steal! We catch them too!
095_troll_guard_1_node3=Him only one around! How it be other ones? Him around when steal happens, so him do stealing!
095_troll_guard_1_transition2_1=So, is you very-sure that prisoner is right one? That prisoner steal you's shiny bars? Him have shiny bars when you catch him?
095_troll_guard_1_transition3_1=Look like there a few problems here. Smell different. Not have bars when caught. Me investigate.
096_start_node2=What ye say may be true, Pretend Robot, but where do we find the scrap we need, if not from the slow, stupid trolls? My crew may be fierce warriors, but we be not prepared to battle ICE GOLEMS and SNOW LEOPARDS every time we desire a broken-down car part! If ye help us by clearing away some of these terrible beasts, we may do as ye say!
096_start_transition2_1=We have a deal, Captain.
IC_003_start_node0=>skkssskk< Gromov? You there? Dave here. I've heard some rumors about the world you're on. It sounds like the >skkssk< folks who could help you get home are the Forest Brotherhood. >kssks<
IC_003_start_node1=No, it's worse than that. >kssks< They're not human, and they're not related to each other. They're >hsskskks<. Did that contraption that you built for your arm make it? Grab it and get in your Goliath and find >kshsks<!
IC_003_start_node2=I said, they're >ffsskkksks< that are extremely >sskksksks< when they >kskksksk<
IC_003_start_transition0_1=The Forest Brotherhood? So a bunch of guys who are related to each other just hanging out in the forest?
IC_003_start_transition1_1=Sorry I didn't get that. Repeat please. Over.
IC_003_start_transition2_1=*shake the radio set*
IC_003_start_node3=[silence]
IC_003_start_transition3_1=*turn off the radio set and sigh mournfully*
006_finish_node0=Ah! Have you brought the notes? Yes, yes, Let's see what we have here... Oh for cryin' out--! These are garbage! I mean, MY suggestion is good, but it's still not exactly right. What can we name the Order?
006_finish_node1=Not bad! Not bad! I think we got it. Time to knock off early and get a drink. Here's your reward. Good job! Oh and if you want help from me, just complete every task written on the board.
006_finish_node2=Oh, listen to Mr. Ideas! All right then, whaddaya got?
006_finish_node3=Too corny! Besides, we're not paladins, we're mercenaries! Sheesh, you're awful at this.
006_finish_node4=Even worse! It sounds like we'll do a job for a nice "thank you" and a hearty handshake. Nuts to that! The name should say we're highly-paid pros! One more try, smarty.
006_finish_transition0_1=C'mon, this isn't that hard. Let's just brainstorm a little. Throw some ideas out.
006_finish_transition1_1=I have to do what now?
006_finish_transition2_1=Well... how about the Order of Paladins?
006_finish_transition3_1=Fine. How about ...Rescue Service?
006_finish_transition4_1=[shrug] I dunno. I guess you could just call yourself "The Order."
006_finish_transition4_2=It's a keepers. It's catchy, and no one is using it yet - I hope.
006_finish_transition4_3=How about the, uh... "Golden Brotherhood?" It sounds like you're pretty expensive, anyway.
006_fox_start_node0=>sniff< This isn't what I expected when I left the Forest Brotherhood. "Come fight for justice," they said. "Be an avenging warrior," they said. But we haven't even figured out a stupid name yet...!
006_fox_start_node1=Anyway, I'm just real tired now and I want to get in my room. The door's locked, but since we're such an IMPORTANT GROUP OF WARRIORS, I'm sure there's a secret entrance somewhere. Please find it and then carry me to my bed. [falls asleep on top of some rocks]
006_fox_start_node2=Oh, sure, I have it, but I can't even get in my stupid ROOM because I drank too much at our celebration for having a successful meeting.
006_fox_start_transition0_1=Hey there, little guy. I, uh, I heard you wrote down your suggestion for the name of your group. Do you have that?
006_fox_start_transition1_1=Okay, and then I'll just quickly grab the piece of paper and uh... [fox snores loudly]...uh, okay.
006_fox_start_transition2_1=Can I help you get in your room?
006_robot_start_node0=>zzt< Name generation... Attempt No. 375… >klik klik ding!< ...No, that is terrible.
006_robot_start_node1=I knew it. My foolish robot brain can't come up with creative ideas. 202 Error: Extreme Sadness. Please take whichever one you like to the boss. I will be here in a feedback loop.
006_robot_start_node2=<zzt bzzt< Oh human, I am trying my hardest, but my creativity module is on the fritz. It is hopeless. >zzt< Here are my three terrible suggestions on the paper if you want to read them. Maybe you can choose.
006_robot_start_transition0_1=Excuse me, Mr. Robot. I'm going around to collect all the name suggestions for your boss. Can I get yours?
006_robot_start_transition1_1=Sheesh. Sorry. I hope you feel better.
006_robot_start_transition2_1=Hmm. "League of Paid Justice" looks pretty solid.
006_robot_start_transition2_2="Shard Guards" is cool. It rhymes!
006_robot_start_transition2_3=Yech. "Avengers on Call" is terrible and possibly a trademark violation, but it's the best of these three.
006_start_node0=Urrgh. Who's making so much noise? Who-- who let this visitor in? You there! >Urrp.< Excuse me. Our Order can't help you now. Schedule an appointment for the... the end of the month or something.
006_start_node1=Okay, one more thing. I don't know if I made this clear, but my notes are with a bunch of terrifying spiders. I mean, I don't think they're so scary, but y'know, you might. The rest of them should be easy enough.
006_start_node2=What, you've never heard of our great Order? Why, we're the greatest... uh, the finest... uh, listen, we're just getting off the ground here. We haven't even come up with a name.
006_start_node3=Okay, so one morning I had a terrible hangov... uhh... I mean, one morning I was meditating and communing with nature, and this idea just came to me. We should create an Order for.. for protecting every creature on the shards! What a great way to make money-- uh, I mean, what a great service we could provide.
006_start_node4=Don't interrupt! So I found a couple of comrades - the best alchemist around and a gunsmith. We're almost there, but here's the thing: we can't come up a name for our Order! I'm kind of lost. Do you know anything about ... brand recognition?
006_start_node5=Mm. Not really. Okay, so I asked everyone to write their best ideas and give them to me. But they're all pretty busy with their work, so they haven't even brought them yet. I mean, I had some ideas written down too, but I uh.. actually lost them when I was running from... Uhh, I mean fighting the spiders. Can you go around and collect the notes? I'll give you a discount on our protection services. You'll be our first client!
006_start_transition0_1=Uh... hi. I didn't even know you guys were in here. What is it that you guys do again?
006_start_transition1_1=I'm not super excited about the spiders. They're kind of gross. I'll do my best, though.
006_start_transition2_1=Okay. Slow start. I get it.
006_start_transition3_1=Not bad. I'm kind of in the helping people business too.
006_start_transition4_1=Well... I tried to get my friends back home to call me "Mr. Tough Stuff", but it didn't work. Does that count?
006_start_transition5_1=Okay. Well, I'll be right back.
011_finish_node0=Have you completed every task? Excellent! We need young and dynamic comrades like you! Congrats! Since now and then you're the order member. Don't thank me!
011_finish_node1=Remember to pay dues no later than the third day of each month! Be honest, fair, and things like that.
011_finish_transition0_1=Uhhh... It's a great honor, and things like that...
011_finish_transition1_1=Okay, boss!
011_start_node0=Ohhh-kay. We're really getting started here. The Order is going to be great. We just have to set everything up JUST RIGHT. So. We're starting a bulletin board so that the members can ask for help with their tasks as they get ready to start their jobs.
011_start_node1=Ha ha! Good thing you're not running this order! You'd be helping people without being properly prepared! What a mess that would be. So if you could help us by checking out the bulletin board, that would be great.
011_start_transition0_1=Don't you think the Order should start helping people instead of just preparing all the time?
011_start_transition1_1=Okay, helping the helpers. Got it.
012_start_node0=Text: "Alchemist needs a voluteer with nerves of steel and a stomach of iron."
012_start_transition0_1=[take the note] That sounds... ominous.
013_start_node0=Text: "The Robot Blacksmith is looking for a messenger made of stainless materials. Knowledge of botany a plus."
013_start_transition0_1=(take the note) Uh-huh. Botany is robot science, right? Got it.
007_finish_node0=You're back! Perfect! What about my potion? First of all: was it delicious? Second: Did it work?
007_finish_node1=Really? Weird. I figured adding the rotten eggs would have at least made it taste funny. Okay, here's your reward. Wanna test another potion?
007_finish_node2=Ooh, gosh. Maybe I'd better go easy on the slugs next time... I thought they'd mask the smell of the deer vomit. Hmm. Anyway, want to try another one?
007_finish_transition0_1=[lie through your teeth] Oh, yeah. Yummy-yum. And it worked great.
007_finish_transition0_2=I really can't imagine trying your cooking at this point. If anything, it made me weaker and I couldn't see anything. And it tasted like fish guts.
007_finish_transition1_1=Er... I do want to help, but... Oh, sure, why not?
007_finish_transition2_1=[take deep breath, suppress gag reflex] Sure.
007_start_node0=What else should I add to the potion? How about green mushrooms, or fish guts, or... a spider? So many great options...
007_start_node1=Here's what you do. Take the potion and go to the shipwreck. Once there, drink it and wait. It's a wild place; someone will definitely attack you. While the potion is active, you'll be incredibly strong. At least I think so... Anyway, will you tell me everything that happens? You know, for scientific purposes?
007_start_node2=Oh, great! Here's the deal. I made a potion, and I need someone who's a little braver than I am to test it out. It's no big deal, just... I have no idea what it will do to you! Right now my theory is that it will make you invincible against all monsters!
007_start_node3=Oh, that would be the fish guts. Yeah, I've never made a battle potion before, but everyone seems to like my cooking...!
007_start_transition0_1=Hey there. [show Fox the card] Got your note.
007_start_transition1_1=Okay, take mystery drinks and fight people for science. Typical Saturday night!
007_start_transition2_1=This seems a little fishy to me.
007_start_transition3_1=No, I mean it's suspicious-- never mind.
008_finish_node0=How did it go? Oh, man, I'm already writing my acceptance speech for the big science award I'm going to get.
008_finish_node1=But it turned you invisible, right? So that you could walk among all the spiders undetected and safe?
008_finish_node2=Hmmm... That's weird. I guess that makes sense, with the ingredients I put in. So much for that science award. Oh, well, I guess I'm glad you survived.
008_finish_transition0_1=Mmm, fine. Pretty good. Not perfect.
008_finish_transition1_1=Uh, no. It actually shrunk me really small so that all the spiders were huge and deadly to me.
008_finish_transition2_1=Uh, thanks. Me too.
008_start_node0=Next up: Invisibility Potion. This is going to put me in the history books! What a breakthrough. And how lucky you are to be part of it, eh?
008_start_node1=You worry too much! Everything will be fine! Anyway, take the potion and go to Spider Island.
008_start_transition0_1=Uh... well, I hate to be a party pooper, but you do have an antidote, right?
008_start_transition1_1=Ha ha! That's funny, I thought you said "Spider Island." Oh, you did? Oh. Uh, okay.
015_finish_node0=>tzzt< Ah! Human! Did you bring me the leaves?
015_finish_node1=>bzzt< Ha ha! Wonderful! Everyone will be fooled. Just have to nail these sticks together and make the swords. Suckers!
015_finish_transition0_1=Yes, so you can trade them for the paint now?
015_finish_transition1_1=Please don't tell anyone I helped you with this.
015_hint_node0=>bzzt zzt< I see that you have enormous armor. I'm afraid the silver plant is afraid of giant creatures.
015_hint_transition0_1=Hmm
015_start_node0=>bzzt< Swords ... Why does he need swords? Illogical! Swords only put tiny holes in people. The most effective weapon is a cannon! Big holes! Right through 'em!
015_start_node1=>ding< Cheap is good! Very logical! Now, I need you to go to the swamp and collect me three silver plants.
015_start_node2=>bzzt zzt< Okay, human, I was ordered to deliver silver swords to the Order's warriors. But I don't have any silver, or any money for silver. >zzt zzt< Calculating solution. >ding< I need to use silver paint on our wooden swords! Perfect solution! Except I don't have any of that, either.
015_start_transition0_1=Hi! I'm here regarding the ad on the board.
015_start_transition1_1=I don't think that's where silver paint comes from.
015_start_transition2_1=Okay, I'm willing to help, although that sounds like a pretty cheap solution.
091_start_humble_bundle_node0=>psst!< Hey! You over there! Yoo hoo! It is I, Manfred the Polyglot! How lucky -- or "Grunzo" as the trolls would say -- I am that you came by. I am in need of your help.
091_start_humble_bundle_node1=Hoo hoo! How did you ever guess? You are very perceptive, my young friend. What the Gnarks would call "Gnark", in fact! Oh my! This is lucky, indeed! I need someone who is quick-witted and sharp-tongued to do me a favor.
091_start_humble_bundle_node2=Why yes! That sounds excellent -- or "Hmmhm-Mmm" as the Golems would say! My conundrum is this: the Forgers -- they're the sinister merchants and artisans that run this city -- would do well to form a trade alliance with the creatures that live in the surrounding hills: Gnarks, Trolls, and Golems. But the Forgers are arrogant, and they will not believe that any of these three tribes are intelligent, no matter how passionately I try to argue with them!
091_start_humble_bundle_node3=Aha ha ha!! That is a good one! Hoo hoo! Oh, human, well done. You have tickled my funny bone! No, the problem most certainly is that the Forgers are idiots and uncultured swine. But ... hmmm...perhaps if you would attempt to talk it through, they would see reason. I have been working to compile a database of  languages in this translator. If you wish to use it, I could sell it to you for 1000 gold. Ahh, then I could afford to get out of...oh, hm-hm, that is not important. 1000 gold.
091_start_humble_bundle_node4=Ah yes, indeed! Here you are! Seek out the trolls, the Gnarks, and the Golems in the hills surrounding here. You will need many conversations with the creatures in order to build its vocabulary. I wish you luck. And I will definitely still be around when you get back. Hoo hoo! Don't you worry on that!
091_start_humble_bundle_node5=If you don't have gold coins, you'll need to drive off some of the monsters around here to earn them. I'll be here waiting! Hee-hee!
091_start_humble_bundle_node6=>bzzt bzzt< Then the price is reduced. 700 gold and it is yours.
091_start_humble_bundle_transition0_1=Yeah? Say, you look like the type who would be in something called the "Forest Brotherhood". Is that right?
091_start_humble_bundle_transition1_1=Actually, this is pretty convenient. I have to ask you a favor, too. You first.
091_start_humble_bundle_transition2_1=Could the problem be that you are a little bit...arrogant?
091_start_humble_bundle_transition3_1=A thousand?? Sheesh, okay.
091_start_humble_bundle_transition3_2=I'm a little short on funds at the moment. Do you take...credit? Never mind, I can trade some of my items for gold coins, or scavange for some.
091_start_humble_bundle_transition4_1=Er, okay, thanks.
091_start_humble_bundle_transition4_2=I'm a little short on funds. I'll be back when I get some more money.
091_start_humble_bundle_transition5_1=Okay
091_start_humble_bundle_transition6_1=Deal.
091_start_humble_bundle_transition6_2=I'm a little short on funds. I'll be back when I get some more money.
091_return_buy_humble_bundle_node0=Helloooo!! Welcome back, friend. Do you have the money?
091_return_buy_humble_bundle_node1=Ah yes. Here you go. Excellent. Here is the translator. It will require many interactions with the creatures in order to build its vocabulary. I wish you luck.
091_return_buy_humble_bundle_transition0_1=Sheesh, I forgot!
091_return_buy_humble_bundle_transition0_2=Yep, here you go, 1000 gold.
091_return_buy_humble_bundle_transition1_1=Okay, after I do all of this for you, you can help me with my thing, right?
091_finish_humble_bundle_node0=[furiously packing bag] Wh-what? Back already? But I didn't have enough time to uh... I mean, hellooo there traveler! What have you found out there in the wild wild wastes?
091_finish_humble_bundle_node1=[reads a few pages] Oh. Very interesting. I didn't know what that word meant. Ohh. That's bad. I've been insulting the Gnarks' mothers for about 5 years.
091_finish_humble_bundle_transition0_1=Check it out. I can communicate with all the Gnarks, Golems, and Trolls now. In fact, we're all pretty good friends.
091_finish_humble_bundle_transition1_1=Awesome. Well, that's done. so now I have a question for you. How do I get home?
091_return_buy_humble_bundle_node2=What? Oh, ho ho, ...yyyees. I will definitely still be around. Okay, now hop to it!
091_return_buy_humble_bundle_transition2_1=Hmm.
091_finish_humble_bundle_node2=Uh... ha ha! Yes, oh, I definitely know this one. You're going to want to go to the we-- I mean north. Definitely north. Yep. that's where it is. Home.
091_finish_humble_bundle_node3=Uh... Yeah, well, still north. No need to thank me. I'll uh... definitely still be here if you need more advice. [continues furiously packing bags]
091_finish_humble_bundle_transition2_1=I haven't even told you where I'm from.
091_finish_humble_bundle_transition3_1=Great. Thanks.
006_fox_start_node3=Oh, yeah, we're such an important group of warriors! Everything we do is such a big deal that... that we have to celebrate every successful thing we do, but we haven't even DONE anything yet!
006_fox_start_transition2_2=A celebration for a meeting?
046_start_node0=Gnark! Stop, creature! I will gnark you in half, you vile thing!
046_start_node1=Human! You gnark my language! You must help! I will -- back! back, you foul gnarking monster! -- I will pay you handsomely!
046_start_node2='Human, I can't even gnark this important information with you until you understand fully. You must gnark your mind to the universe!
046_start_transition0_1=Hi. Uh, who are you ...um, gnarking to?
046_start_transition1_1=What? What can I do? What's ...uh, gnarking on here? Are you fighting something ...invisible?
046_start_transition2_1=How do I do that?
046_hat_first_node0=Hello, human. You look like you are in the market for a delightful tin foil hat.
046_hat_first_node1=It can be yours for 100,000 coins!
046_hat_first_node2=Ah, pretty savvy, aren't you? I usually get some suckers with that one. How about this, my sharp young friend: 1,000 gold and it's yours.
046_hat_first_transition0_1=Yes. I'm told I need it for... something.
046_hat_first_transition1_1=[spit out drink] Are you kidding me?? How stupid do you think I am?
046_hat_first_transition2_1=Ha! I knew I was too smart for you. Here's your 1,000 coins for a ten-cent piece of tinfoil, sucker.
046_finish_node0=Do you gnark better? Can you gnark the purity, human?
046_finish_node1=You're gnarking just fine, human. Purity will envelop you in time.
046_finish_transition0_1=Yeah, I think it was the right lake. Listen, is this absolutely necessary?
046_finish_transition1_1=Okay, if you say so.
048_start_node0=Human! You're back! It's starting to happen -- did you gnark your cap?
048_start_node1=Put it on! You gotta gnark this, man..
048_start_transition0_1=Yep, got it!
048_start_transition1_1=*sigh* *puts on the cap*
048_find_water_for_sword_node0=[Previously invisible coyotes suddenly appear] See 'em now?? What did I tell you?
048_find_water_for_sword_node1=Going crazy is lonely, so it's nice to have some company. Thanks, human! Okay, now, we must gnark these creatures. To do that, you need to craft a sword from another dimension! Here's a jar. Fill it with water from the well under the star and then you can gnark your sword according to this manual. We must eliminate them!
048_find_water_for_sword_transition0_1=Whoa. I guess we've both gone insane together.
048_find_water_for_sword_transition1_1=Okay, here we go!
048_finish_node0=We've done it, human. We've gnarked the invisible coyotes with the sword from another dimension.
048_finish_node1=[solemnly hands over some dirty pieces of paper with crudely drawn numbers on them] Here is your reward, great warrior.
048_finish_node2=Spend it wisely!
048_finish_transition0_1=Pretty typical Tuesday for me.
048_finish_transition1_1=Wait, what the heck is this? It looks like you drew these yourself.
048_finish_transition2_1=Unbelievable.
091_return_buy_humble_bundle_node3=If you don't have gold coins, you'll need to drive off some of the monsters around here to earn them. I'll be here waiting! Hee-hee!
091_return_buy_humble_bundle_transition3_1=Okay, thanks!
092_after_fight_3_node0=Gnark Gnark Gnark, Gnark Gnark Gnark! [Translator: They may take our Gnark, but they’ll never Gnark our Gnark!]
092_after_fight_3_transition0_1=Is that a Scottish brogue I hear? Whew...this looks like the last of them. Finish him off and it's back to their leader for some haggis I guess.
006_fox_start_transition3_1=Gotcha.
093_start_node2=Hmm humm-HM! [Translator: Do not touch that!]
093_start_transition2_1=I'm guessing if I grab this, they'll shout their heads off at me. I just need them to yell long enough for me to fill up the translator and then I can put this back.
113_start_node0=Ah, human, I hope you do not come to speak to us on behalf of the two idiot factions.
113_start_node1=Looking out for number one, eh? I respect that, human. But you seem to be allied with the Nerd-bots and the Tree-huggers a little too much. You're going to earn the trust of the Forgers, you know.
113_start_transition0_1=No. This time, I am working in my own self-interest. I need the secret instructions for the transporter so I can get to the Citadel and go home.
113_start_transition1_1=All right, what do you need me to do?
114_start_node0=Stone Pants. It is good to see a friendly face. How I regret ever engaging with those devilish merchants.
114_start_node1=Oh, I don't know about that, Stone Pants. If you were to fall into the hands of the Forgers, or worse -- join their cause -- they would be miles ahead of us in terms of reaching the goal. As much as I would like you to help your frient, we require a stronger show of loyalty to the Brotherhood.
114_start_transition0_1=I'm not too excited about how that went either. Listen. I have a friend who is at the Citadel and is injured. I have to get to him and I have to get home. Can you please help me and tell me the method for overcoming the force barrier?
114_start_transition1_1=All right, I'm ready. What do you need me to do?
114_finish_node0=Stone Pants! How could I have ever doubted you! You are a true friend of the Brotherhood.
114_finish_node1=Absolutely. What you need to do is follow this ritual and the barrier will not affect you. Lean in close and I will whisper the incantation in your ear.
114_finish_transition0_1=Thanks, Fentus. It feels good to be on the side of the Forest. Can you help me with the secret to the force barrier so that I can find my friend?
114_finish_transition1_1=Mm-hmm. Okay. Got it. Thank you.
115_start_node0=Ohhh... Traveler, why you wake me up from peaceful contemplation? This place. It so calm. So right.
115_start_node1=That... sort of specific. Well, well, young one. Maybe you worthy to learn from me, maybe not. But me see too much darkness in you to begin. You's soul need to be cleansed.
115_start_transition0_1=I have come to learn from you, teacher. Your wisdom and knowledge is famous the world over. Please let me hear your words, particularly er... about the codes you learned from the Knowledge Receptacle and the Patriarch of the Created. Uh... for example.
115_start_transition1_1=Cleansed? What do you mean?
115_finish_node0=Killed Castle?
115_finish_node1=Cool.
115_finish_transition0_1=Yes
115_finish_transition1_1=Yes
IC_004_start_node0=>skksk< Gromov! What on all of the Shard worlds is going on over there?
IC_004_start_node1=>skks< Gromov-- you have to do this. We have to succeed. You have to make it here. We have to make it off this world and back home. To Earth. We will do it.
IC_004_start_transition0_1=I don't know what I can do. The factions all have their own goals, and none of them line up! None of the leaders will even think about working together. It's so frustrating I'm just about ready to give up.
IC_004_start_transition1_1=But how? I can't see--
IC_005_start_node0=>skrrk< Gromov! It's Dave! I've done it! I've figured out a way to get to the Created's codes from the Patriarch!
IC_005_start_node1=Oh, I have my ways. It's just information; that stuff is easy to get if you go through the right channels. Here's the thing. Remember the people who worshipped the metal ball from the sky?
IC_005_start_transition0_1=Whoa! How did you do that? I thought you were injured!
IC_005_start_transition1_1=How could I forget? Boy, I'm glad that's over with. Those guys were crazy!
115_kill_castle_node0=You back. Is you soul cleansed? Did you challenge all aspects of you life, and doubt everything you thought you knew?
115_kill_castle_node1=And yet me see that you have cleansed anyway. Still got lots of darkness. Sadness. But something different. That good. You can have map to Knowledge. You do good things with it.
115_kill_castle_transition0_1=Uh... oh, yeah, right. Y-you must be crazy if you think I did all that stuff.
115_kill_castle_transition1_1=Thank you, crazy man.
115_daive_after_kill_castle_node0=>skkrrk< Gromov! How's your progress, buddy?
115_daive_after_kill_castle_node1=>sigh< Gromov, there's a lot about this world -- this situation -- that you're not seeing. I don't know if it's the crash, or the nature of this world, or what, but I didn't want to tell you. We needed to find each other and get off this rock. What came before isn't important.
115_daive_after_kill_castle_transition0_1=Weird. I just defeated a giant castle monster, but you may be surprised to know that's not the weird part. There were lots of ...things flying around and whispering to me. They were telling me stuff that... Listen, I don't know how to put this, but is this ... this world ... us being here ... is this MY fault? Have I done this to you?
115_daive_after_kill_castle_transition1_1=WHAT isn't important? WHAT??
IC_006_start_node0=>kskksk< Gromov! It's Dave! You have to make it to the Library of Wisdom!
IC_006_start_node1=>skks< But be careful out there -- there's no telling who you'll run into!
IC_006_start_transition0_1=OK
IC_006_start_transition1_1=OK
116_start_node0=Who are you, fleshy human? What brings you here?
116_start_node1=I could, but it seems you are not quite proven as an ally to the Created, despite your clear skill in creating robotic bodies.
116_start_node2=Oh, I have a number of little tasks I will need you to do. Are you ready?
116_start_transition0_1=I spoke to a crazy shaman and he sent me here. I am on a mission to get home, and I need the Library of Wisdom so that I can find the proper way. Can you help me?
116_start_transition1_1=What can I do to help, then?
116_start_transition2_1=Always.
116_back_to_patriarch_node0=You are back, then. Have you accomplished all of our tasks?
116_back_to_patriarch_node1=Then you are one of us now. I grant you access to the Library of Wisdom. Use it and the information you find wisely, my friend.
116_back_to_patriarch_transition0_1=You bet.
116_back_to_patriarch_transition1_1=Excellent. Thank you.
116_creatures_terminal_node0=[a black screen with blocky green letters sits in front of you, and some sort of typewriter is under your fingers.]
116_creatures_terminal_node1=Beep! Ding! Coordinates successfully copied.
116_creatures_terminal_transition0_1=Um... Please... give... me... the... coordinates... to ...the... Citadel ... at.... the ...center... of ...this... world.
116_creatures_terminal_transition1_1=Awesome!
117_choose_daemons_node0=Well, well. Look who it is. Little Human with the big metal suit. What do you need?
117_choose_daemons_node1=Very well. I see that you are a kindred spirit. Getting it done with no fussing about feelings. That I definitely respect.
117_choose_daemons_transition0_1=I've got what I need. It's WHO I need that's important. I'm going to the Citadel and I'm going to require some workers to build the portal. You're the faction I want with me. Are you in?
117_choose_daemons_transition1_1=Right, well, I've got a design for the portal and all we need is a site and some workers to create the components.
117_choose_daemons_denied_node0=What do YOU want, little human? More to the point, what have you done for us lately? I've got things that need doing if you're bored, so either do 'em or get out of my way.
117_choose_daemons_denied_transition0_1=Right, uh, okay. I'll see you later.
117_choose_robots_node0=Creator! It warms my diodes to see you. What can I do for you?
117_choose_robots_node1=Creator, those are fine words to hear! We are glad to join you on your quest, and naturally, we have just the way to find that perfect spot fo the portal.
117_choose_robots_transition0_1=I need backup. I have the plans to build the portal to get to the Citadel, but I need help building it and I need a way to find the proper location. I choose the Created -- I want you to be my allies from now on.
117_choose_robots_transition1_1=Fantastic. Let's go.
117_choose_robots_denied_node0=Hmm. Creator, it is good to see you, but your work with the other factions has made some of us wonder if you are really on the side of the Created after all. I believe in you, and perhaps if you were to perform some more tasks for us, we could change our minds.
117_choose_robots_denied_transition0_1=All right. I will get on that.
117_choose_foxes_node0=Stone Pants! Ah, welcome, welcome!! What can the humble Brotherhood do for you?
117_choose_foxes_node1=My, yes! Stone Pants, the Brotherhood would follow you to the ends of the Shards. We even know just the way to find the perfect spot to build your portal. We're with you all the way!
117_choose_foxes_transition0_1=I know what needs to happen now. I need the Brotherhood to join me, help me build a portal, and reach the Citadel so I can get home. Are you with me?
117_choose_foxes_transition1_1=Perfect! Let's go!
117_choose_foxes_denied_node0=Mm, let's see, Stone Pants. You've been doing an awful lot of work with the other factions lately. I don't know that you have the Forest's best interests at heart. But don't despair! I know you are with us in your heart; we just want to see it.
117_choose_foxes_denied_transition0_1=Okay, I will do some more work with your faction.
IC_007_start_node0=>kkrrk< Gromov. How are you doing? Did you get the information from the Shaman-guy?
117_choose_daemons_transition0_2=Uphh. I changed my mind! Bye!
117_choose_robots_transition0_2=Uphh. I changed my mind! Bye!
117_choose_foxes_transition0_2=Uphh. I changed my mind! Bye!
117_choose_daemons_transition2_2=Uphh. I changed my mind! Bye!
117_choose_robots_transition1_2=Uphh. I changed my mind! Bye!
117_choose_foxes_transition1_2=Uphh. I changed my mind! Bye!
IC_007_start_node1=Forget it. Don't worry about it. You know me. I move on easily. Don't you remember?
IC_007_start_transition0_1=I... yes. A-and I'm fine. H-how are you? I guess this is a little bit awkward. I feel like we need to hash all of this out, but--
IC_007_start_transition1_1=N-no, I don't remember. I don't remember at all!
117_engineer_call_1_node0=Gromov, this is engineer speaking. We receive your signal but it's not strong enough. Are you even trying? Get to a better site. Here are the coordinates.
117_engineer_call_1_transition0_1=Got it.
117_engineer_call_2_node0=We receive your signal, Gromov, but it's not strong enough. Seems like you're in a jungle or something. That's stupid. Get to a better site. Here are the coordinates. It's an older world, almost forgotten.
117_engineer_call_2_transition0_1=Got it.
117_engineer_call_3_node0=Gromov, this is engineer. This is almost impossible, but we're not getting any signal at all. But the Citadel signal broadcasts everywhere in the world, no exceptions. I can only imagine that the signal is blocked by another shard. A shard that doesn't show up on any of our charts. This is what comes of imposing your will on the world: we discover new things. I am sending you the coordinates of this lost world. That is where we will build the portal.
117_engineer_call_3_transition0_1=Got it.
IC_008_start_node0=>skksk< Gromov! Hey buddy. Have you heard anything?
IC_008_start_node1=That's fantastic! Way to go. Okay, send me the coordinates and we'll meet there.
IC_008_start_node2=Okay, now you hold tight. I'm going. I'll make sure it's okay for you.
IC_008_start_transition0_1=You bet we have! Our crew has found the coordinates for the perfect portal build site so we can get to the Citadel. It's a lost Shard, not on any of the charts! As soon as we make it there, we'll build the portal, and then you and I can go home! I can fix everything I messed up.
IC_008_start_transition1_1=[send coordinates]
IC_008_start_transition2_1=Okay for us? We're a whole army! You're just one person, and you're injured. Why are you going? Wait for us! Dave!
118_start_node0=By all the circuits in ancient world, who is this? It has been a metric millennium since I have been disturbed, now my home is like some kind of marketplace! And who are you, a machine with a human heart?
118_start_node1=Isn't that interesting? Another warrior. Another battle. Another death. Perhaps when you lay dying, I will reach my tendrils into your mind and upload it. Put you in the electronic zoo in my archives.
118_start_transition0_1=No. I am Gromov. I am here to build a portal that will bring me and my companions to the Citadel, find my friend, go home, and undo all the bad I've done.
118_start_transition1_1=Another...? Who has been here before? Who did you fight?
119_fake_dave_node0=Surprised? We have a lot to talk about... alone. [stomps on faction member]
119_fake_dave_node1=Yes, I suppose you have been calling me Dave, haven't you? I am the center of this world. The intelligence that holds all this together. But oh, yes, Dave's mind lives on. He came to me long ago, from a plane crash, was it?. Landed right next to my little robot, he did. Nearly dead. And then that little robot-eater just loves to upload their minds. Keeps them in a zoo, he does. But this one -- Dave -- well, there was so much anger in him. Betrayal, he said.
119_fake_dave_node2=Angry at you, it seems. Yeess... How sweet it tasted, too. I couldn't just let the Robot Eater keep him. I had to sample it. I had to ...become Dave. So delicious, his hate was every time I encouraged you, he just filled with anger.
119_fake_dave_transition0_1=D-Dave? H-how...? I-I thought you were dead. Wh-what are you doing?
119_fake_dave_transition1_1=No...
119_fake_dave_transition2_1=NO! Dave, are you in there? Is there anything left of you? Please!
IC_010_start_node0=Gromov, it's Dave again. Did you get the map?
IC_010_start_node1=Oh my God. I was hoping that it would be easier than that ... Great that you're alive. You need to go to the Created and ask them what they know about our situation. This should help us.
IC_010_start_transition0_1=If you "get", that means that you "broke a giant crazy robot that can dig a hectare of land for a second", then yes.
IC_010_start_transition1_1=Hopefully, these Creatured will not be any giant machines of death ... Talk to you later, Dave.
026_finish_node0=Have you learned why the forest is dying?
026_finish_node1=They behave like kids. What a silly idea to feed spiders a bunch of junk. Okay, I'll help them with an antidote. Thank you for your work.
026_finish_transition0_1=(Tell about gnarks)
026_finish_transition1_1=Happy to help.
026_gnark_1_node0=Ruffler! You monster! How could you? I will make mincemeat of you for this!
026_gnark_1_transition0_1=Who's the monster, me? So what do you then call this thing? Mr. Fluffington? [Defend]
026_gnark_2_node0=Wait, take it easy! We quarreled, I got excited, but we can work this out! I was just angry because uh... you messed up.
026_gnark_2_node1=Brotherhood? These hairy arrogant and clever foxes... They do not pay attention to gnarks. But if you can convince them ... Then the village will be saved. Will you help us?
026_gnark_2_node2=Forest? Who cares about the forest? I have raised my little pet on a diet of radioactive waste for two months. There is a terrible disease in our village - everyone is dying, especially the young. And the diluted poison of spiders works as a medicine! But ordinary spiders only produce a tiny amount. Only Ruffler could produce enough. And now you've killed him!
026_gnark_2_transition0_1=Messed up? I saved the forest, and avenged the deaths of all this creature killed!
026_gnark_2_transition1_1=Well, I can convince them. But stop treating people with unknown poisonous medicine, okay?
026_gnark_2_transition2_1=Disease? And did you try to talk to the Brotherhood? These guys know a lot about medicine.
026_start_node0=I can hear the whisper of the forest ... Near-death whisper ... They hurt ...
026_start_node1=Oh, sorry. These voices, pleading for help ... Something is happening in the forest, something very dangerous. And now the forest is dying. You look good, traveler. I beg you, help me to find the cause. Help me to save the forest.
026_start_transition0_1=Um ... hello?
026_start_transition1_1=It sounds serious. I'll find out what the thing is.
027_1_node0=Dang it! You scared me! How could you get here and who are you?
027_1_node1=It would be better for all of us! Tell everyone they have to leave this place as soon as possible. They must abandon their portals!
027_1_node2=Ari? Thank God! Tell her that portals are very very dangerous. We should not deal with them! Never, do you hear? Tell her, now!
027_1_node3=Scared? You made a mistake! Nothing happened! Everyting is OK, do you hear? Everything is fine! But we have to get out of here, now! Me and Ari, and everyone else! And you too!
027_1_transition0_1=Calm down! You are the fox, right? Your sister Ari sent me.
027_1_transition1_1=I'll do anything, do not worry [it's all very, very suspicious]
027_1_transition2_1=What’s happened? Why do you look so frightened?
027_1_transition3_1=Am I too? Why?
027_2_node0=A dead fox lies on the ground. There is an old scar on her neck, just like Ari said. So it is her.
027_2_node1=The way Brotherhood members dress can cause a lot of questions, but there is definitely nothing suspicious.
027_2_node2=The fox would seem to be asleep, if not for the huge wound through her head. It seems that the blow was from above, hard and with something heavy and sharp.
027_2_node3=Legs, ordinary for Brotherhood entities, were covered with short red hair. Nothing unusual.
027_2_node4=Fox holds a piece of ribbon in her hand. The letters on the ribbon say: Bork.
027_2_transition0_1=Search its clothes.
027_2_transition0_2=Search fox’s head.
027_2_transition0_3=Search the fox’s legs
027_2_transition0_4=Search the fox's paws.
027_2_transition1_1=Search fox’s head.
027_2_transition1_2=Search the fox’s legs
027_2_transition1_3=Search the fox's paws.
027_2_transition1_4=[finish the examination]
027_2_transition2_1=Search its clothes.
027_2_transition2_2=Search the fox’s legs
027_2_transition2_3=Search the fox's paws.
027_2_transition2_4=[finish the examination]
027_2_transition3_1=Search its clothes.
027_2_transition3_2=Search fox’s head.
027_2_transition3_3=Search the fox's paws.
027_2_transition3_4=[finish the examination]
027_2_transition4_1=Search its clothes.
027_2_transition4_2=Search fox’s head.
027_2_transition4_3=Search the fox’s legs
027_2_transition4_4=[finish the examination]
027_3_node0=Dead fox lies in a pool of blood. The hair on the head has a white stripe - a sure sign it's a fox.
027_3_node1=Nothing unusual. Besides that these are legs of a giant anthropomorphic fox.
027_3_node2=Clothes does not contain any hints, but there is a huge cut across the fox chest. It is obvious that it caused the death.
027_3_node3=The poor fox's head has nothing unusual but memorable marks - a bright silver spot in her hair. Normal for a fox.
027_3_node4=The dead fox's paws contain nothing.
027_3_transition0_1=Search the fox's paws.
027_3_transition0_2=Search fox’s head.
027_3_transition0_3=Search fox’s clothes.
027_3_transition0_4=Search fox’s legs.

027_3_transition4_4=[finish the examination]
027_borg_node0=Why you come to Borg’s area? Borg not glad to see you. Borg not glad to see anybody.
027_borg_node1=Borg hate these stupid furballs! If caravan not go past - Borg not eat! Borg say stop, they not stop! So Borg make them stop! And Borg make you go away! [With a wild yell Borg attacks]
027_borg_node2=Borg not know any stupid foxes. Borg not kill anyone. Borg rob caravans. Borg want you to go away!
027_borg_transition0_1=Do you know anything about foxes? Especially the ones that worked with portals?
027_borg_transition1_1=[Defend]
027_borg_transition2_1=I didn't say that they were killed. ... Foxes are trying to make portals for travelers, which would make it harder for you to rob them. So you killed the foxes!
027_finish_bad_node0=A dead fox lies on the ground. This is Ari. There is a note next to her. It says "Gromov"
027_finish_bad_node1=[The wind moves the hair on Ari's body. It's very quiet around]
027_finish_bad_transition0_1=What's ... What's happened?
027_finish_bad_transition1_1=Curses ...
027_finish_ok_node0=Did you deal with Borg?
027_finish_ok_node1=This will not bring them back ... But I'm glad that he has paid for what he did. Thank you.
027_finish_ok_transition0_1=He will not bother anyone. Portals for safe travel were going to stop Borg from robbing caravans, and he was trying to stop you.
027_finish_ok_transition1_1=Accept my condolences. I'm sorry for your loss.
027_GOLEM_1_node0=Death! Blood! Death! .. [Golem is sullenly looking down and continuously repeats the same thing]
027_GOLEM_1_node1=[Golem is unintelligible growling]
027_GOLEM_1_node2=[Golem raises his head at you and slowly said with heavy voice] ... Death … Earlier shaggy host was alive ... but dead now.
027_GOLEM_1_transition0_1=Did you kill it?
027_GOLEM_1_transition1_1=It seems that you will not say anything.
027_GOLEM_1_transition2_1=What happened?
027_middle_node0=Do you know what happened to my sisters? Please!
027_middle_node1=Who did that? We have to figure it out!
027_middle_node2=It's all so terrible ... And so confusing. What do you think, what happened there?
027_middle_node3=I don't think so. No one can walk through the portal without the foxes' permission. And even if he tried, the fox could close the portal at any moment. No, the killer obviously didn't come from the portal.
027_middle_node4=I don't know ... I remember this golem. He served my sister well, and seemed to care for her. But maybe he lost his mind.
027_middle_node5=Borg? I remember the name. A local thug, I think. A highwayman, or something like that. He's an idiot, but quick and cruel.
027_middle_node6=Many of entities on shards are extremely strong ... Although not all of them may have the weapon.
027_middle_transition0_1=[tell about everything]
027_middle_transition1_1=Borg is a killer.
027_middle_transition1_2=Golem did it.
027_middle_transition2_1=Maybe something came out of the portal and killed them?
027_middle_transition3_1=I saw the golem. He does seem to have lost his mind. Maybe it was him?
027_middle_transition3_2=One fox was holding a piece of paper with a single word - Borg.
027_middle_transition3_3=Judging from the fox's wound, the stroke was made with sharp cutting weapon. Perhaps a large knife.
027_middle_transition4_1=One fox was holding a piece of paper with a word - Borg.
027_middle_transition4_2=Judging from the wounds, the death blow was made with a sharp cutting weapon, delivered with great force.
027_middle_transition4_3=I think I know who the killer is!
027_middle_transition5_1=I saw the golem. He does seem to have lost his mind. Maybe it was him?
027_middle_transition5_2=Judging from the wounds, the death blow was made with a sharp cutting weapon, delivered with great force.
027_middle_transition5_3=I think I know who the killer is!
027_middle_transition6_1=I saw the golem. He does seem to have lost his mind. Maybe it was him?
027_middle_transition6_2=One fox was holding a piece of paper with a word - Borg.
027_middle_transition6_3=I think I know who the killer is!
027_start_node0=[When you approach, the fox grabs your hand and begins to speak quickly and incoherently, looking straight into yout eyes] You look like an experienced warrior and stranger. It this true? Am I right?
027_start_node1=Thank you, stranger. I'll wait for you here. Be careful, and please find out the truth. Sometimes it can be more complicated than it seems at first glance.
027_start_node2=We are sisters, twins, and I feel in my heart that there is something wrong. Strange things have been happening when we work on different teleporters ... It can be dangerous, so I need an experienced warrior. Can you help me find them? My sisters, three foxes? I'll tell you what they look like and where I last saw them...
027_start_node3=Oh, sorry. I am Ari, master of movements. The fact is: my sisters ... They also worked on the teleporters, like me ... but one day they were gone. We agreed to meet here after the next series of experiments, but I've been waiting for them for a long time - and they never showed. I'm afraid that something terrible has happened.
027_start_transition0_1=A stranger and a warrior? That's me. And who are you? What happened?
027_start_transition1_1=[Go away]
027_start_transition2_1=All right, I'll find your sisters.
027_start_transition3_1=Maybe I need to wait a little longer.
031_finish_node0=You're alive! Then you truly are a noble warrior. So, how do you like my babies?
031_finish_transition0_1=You were right, they are just super. The show in the arena promises to be really cool.
031_start_node0=What do you want, kid? Speak up; I don't have all day. I'm a busy man!
031_start_node1=This? This is the arena, guy! The place for real soldiers and fighters. And I'm the boss. You ready to fight, and make me some money?
031_start_node2=Our doors have just opened. But don't you worry! Soon there will be thousands of spectators! There will be lines to the horizon just to see how these great warriors and horrible birds match up!
031_start_node3=C'mon, kid, you're new and just don't know our birds! This is an exclusive breed! So. Let's bet. There are just a few nests nearby. Can you clean them - I will pay you. When I started breeding birds for the arena, I got carried away a little, and now the dang things are everywhere!
031_start_node4=You're not listening to me! I'm telling you, these are not your run-of-the-mill forest birds, this breed is one-of-a-kind! You won't believe your eyes.
031_start_transition0_1=What kind of place is it?
031_start_transition1_1=Not much of an audience here.
031_start_transition2_1=With birds? And what's so interesting about it? They seem pretty harmless
031_start_transition3_1=You'll pay me if I kill a couple of birds? Really?
031_start_transition4_1=Sounds suspicious ... I'll have to watch my step.
033_finish_node0=[The fox is curled up and lightly snoring]
033_finish_node1=It's gone! I can't believe it, but I can sleep again! It's amazing! You are my hero!
033_finish_transition0_1=Good morning, treasure hunter! I see that everything worked out.
033_finish_transition1_1=Don't mention it! And if you find that gold - call me first, okay?
033_start_node0=Leave me alone, traveler. I'm cursed, and I've got no time for you.
033_start_node1=Greed! Greed and love for treasures killed me! Listen now to my story of shame. A few weeks ago, I wandered into an abandoned camp and took some gold. It's what I do! But NO! The spirits of the dead grew angry with me and now they torment me in my dreams. I've returned the gold, I've done everything I can, but still they chase me.
033_start_node2=Don’t make jokes about what you don’t understand! Listen! I found a scroll with a spell that will make spirits return to the land of the dead. Now I can go to that place and kill them. Alas, friend, looking for the scroll really took it out of me, and I don't have anything left to fight the spirits.
033_start_node3=[fox looks at you for a long time] I’m not sure that's a good idea. If you’re willing to risk it and fight spirits, here’s the scroll. I’ll tell all the foxes about your feat in story and song!
033_start_transition0_1=You look sad. Can I help?
033_start_transition1_1=Are you serious? Spirits? Could it be your conscience instead?
033_start_transition2_1=I don't believe in spirits, and I can read. I can kill them for you.
033_start_transition3_1=Deal! Give me that paper.
029_finish_node0=Thank you! I thank you with all my heart.
029_finish_node1=Now I have a pet and together we can deal with any troubles.
029_finish_transition0_1=So what?
029_finish_transition1_1=I hope you'll be OK... Good luck my friend!
029_start_node0=Wow! Another human! Finally, I'm not the last human in this town!
029_start_node1=I already have a trap! Here it is! Get something little and furry for me. All must be so as we people like.
029_start_node2=Sure, I am a human! As you see, I have no number at my forehead! [The golem points at his forehead where there is white paint residue which looks like it was sanded off]. I even have a name! My name is... Truehuman!
029_start_node3=It's not that great. Look around you.. [The golem leans in to your ear and starts speaking in a whisper] There are only golems in this place! We humans  have no one to talk with. Sometimes I feel very lonely.
029_start_node4=Maybe you will help me? As a favor from one human to another? I wish I had some little domestic animal... Or even a wild one! I would feel much less lonely...
029_start_transition0_1=But you are a golem... or not?
029_start_transition1_1=(Leave)
029_start_transition2_1=OK... So, why are you here, er... Truehuman?
029_start_transition3_1=I understand you very well. It's terrible!
029_start_transition4_1=I think I can help you. But how can I catch that little animal?
041(0)_sten_base_node0=Welcome to the Hut of Wonders, man! My name is Stan, man, and I will show you the most wonderful and amazing artifacts in the whole world, man! It's cheap, man, just a couple coins! By the way, don't forget to exit through the souvenir store, man, we've got a big sale going on!
041(0)_sten_base_node1=Are you a cop, man?.. Ha-ha! Just joking, man, there are no police here in the fragments, man, in this free and beautiful world! I buy them from heroes and adventurers coming to my fire. So, if you find the Holy Grail, the Philosopher's Stone or rare baseball cards - bring them here immediately, man! I'll buy them for the best price in the swamps.
041(0)_sten_base_transition0_1=No thanks. Where get you all these items from?
041(0)_sten_base_transition0_2=Here is a plate that says "Singing spider", but there's nothing on it. Is it invisible?
041_finish_node0=My spider is back! Is it OK, man? Nobody has hurt it, right?
041_finish_node1=Ah, creative individuals, you know, man? You never know what to expect from them! Thank you for help and please come to the next concert! Actually, that one's sold out... Oh, yeah, and so is the next one... Well... Maybe next October?
041_finish_transition0_1=All's well. It was a little writer's block, but it's gone now.
041_finish_transition0_2=That little spider is a menace! It became the King of the spiders and tried to kill me!
041_finish_transition1_1=Thank you for the invitation. Sure.
041_start_node0=Oh it's tragedy, a really tragedy my friend... The singing spider was a real pearl of my collection! Sapphire! Diamond! When it sang, my visitors would weep with joy and spend all of their money. It was only one time, but it was a revelation, man! But now, my little spider decided that it's going to be a real star and left me. It said it's starting a solo career. I miss that little guy so much, man...
041_start_node1=Yeah, it's a sad story... Hey man, I know how you can help me! Just talk with my little singing spider, OK? Bring the little guy back. It's not about money, man, it's that the spider has never been in the wild, you know? It's totally dependent. And now it's alone, in the forest... Such a talent is going to be lost!
041_start_transition0_1=What a sad story about lost profit.
041_start_transition1_1=I'll try to talk with your little spider. Maybe it'll change its mind.
042_finish_node0=*ahem* Did you get my vine? Give it to me, now!
042_finish_node1=LAH-LAH-LAH-LAAAAAAH! Hmm... It's been better, but my voice is certainly back. DO-RE-MI... Yes, I'm magnificent! Bravo to me, bravo!
042_finish_transition0_1=Here it is. No thanks required, though it looks like you weren't going to anyway.
042_finish_transition1_1=And? Are you ready to go back to Stan? To the warm and comfortable Hut of Wonders?
042_start_node0=[Well-groomed shining spider looks at you with all the contempt it can muster]
042_start_node1=Could you? You MUST help me! *ahem* There are pirates not far from here - they have some resources, I'm sure. Get me some vines, and quickly! And sure, I'll return to Stan, believe me - it's so boring living here alone.
042_start_node2=[The spider takes a look at you with cold eyes]
042_start_node3=[The spider rolls its eyes and makes a loud snort]
042_start_node4=[The singing spider proudly blows its cheeks and nods condescendingly]
042_start_node5=OKAY?! How dare you! Teasing the poor artist that has temporarily lost his voice! *ahem* You are a monster!
042_start_node6=I rehearsed an aria from my new musical "Singing Spider is a Superstar". It will be a masterwork! But it's so cold and humid here... *ahem* These are no conditions for the true artist, and now I've lost my voice! What a tragedy! Only hot vine can help me now, but I don't have any!
042_start_transition0_1=It's that legendary singing spider!
042_start_transition0_2=I came to ask you to go back to the Hut of Wonders.
042_start_transition0_3=Stan asks you to go back. He misses you.
042_start_transition1_1=Vine? Very strange medicine, but... OK, I'll get it.
042_start_transition2_1=It's that legendary singing spider!
042_start_transition2_2=Stan asks you to go back. He misses you.
042_start_transition2_3=I've heard you are an okay singer...
042_start_transition3_1=It's that legendary singing spider!
042_start_transition3_2=I came to make you go back to the Hut of Wonders.
042_start_transition3_3=I've heard you are an okay singer...
042_start_transition4_1=It's that legendary singing spider!
042_start_transition4_2=I came to make you go back to the Hut of Wonders.
042_start_transition4_3=Stan asks you to go back. He misses you.
042_start_transition4_4=I've heard you are an okay singer...
042_start_transition5_1=What happened?!
042_start_transition6_1=I can help you to find the vine, if you'll go back to Stan.
043_finish_node0=Where is my coat? Did you get it?
043_finish_node1=Very, very well... Now, I have everything for my triumphant debut!
043_finish_node2=Oh they are my best fans. True admirers of my talent. Never mind. They're giving me my due, finally.
043_finish_transition0_1=Here is it! Wear it in good health.
043_finish_transition0_2=What are these spiders around you? Is that kind of meeting?
043_finish_transition1_1=Happy now? Shall we go back to the Hut of Wonders?
043_finish_transition2_1=Here is it. Wear it in good health.
043_start_node0=To the Hut? Oh, yeah, yeah... Are you blind? I don't even have my new concert suit! How can I give a performance without a new suit?
043_start_node1=Do you see a sign by me that says "Coat consultant"? No? That's right, because I have no idea where you will get it! That's your job! Oh, wait. There is this one cave. I have heard Stan say once that there may be a good pelt in there. So, hop to it.
043_start_node2=Hey boy, let's get real! I am an artist and I can't be a star in those old rags! A new suit is vital for me. The best suit!
043_start_node3=The coat! I want a great, snow-white, shining coat! I want everyone to see that I am a superstar!
043_start_transition0_1=Hey we had a deal!
043_start_transition1_1=What the heck is going on... Wait here. [This spider is insane!]
043_start_transition2_1=And what do you want from me?
043_start_transition3_1=And where I can get a white coat for you?
044_finish_node0=What have you done! You've killed all of my new servants! How can be the king without an entourage? What should I do now?
044_finish_node1=You say that like I have a choice, you naysayer! OK, fine, I'll go back to Stan. As if I could go anywhere else.
044_finish_transition0_1=I think it's time to go back to Stan. And to continue my singing career.
044_finish_transition1_1=I suggest we don't stay here for long, your ex-grace.
044_start_node0=At last! Now I am a true King of spiders! And all spiders of swamps will follow me!
044_start_node1=HA-HA-HA! The king can break any agreement - and I am the King! Nobody can tell me no! My loyal guardians! A royal decree! Kill this jerk and save me from his lectures! Now!
044_start_transition0_1=I see you decided to break our agreement...
044_start_transition1_1=Ah you little spider... [Protect yourself!]
052_finish_node0=Have you brought the chain mace?
052_finish_node1=What are you talking about? Bonan was alive? This makes the exhibit even more valuable. Wonderful! It’s a pity you haven’t invited him here, but I guess the chain mace is enough...
052_finish_transition0_1=It was not easy...
052_finish_transition1_1=Bye!
052_start_node0=Hey buddy! Can you dig?
052_start_node1=I marked a place on the map where you can find a grave. Don't even think about laying your hands on the staff! It will earn so much mon... er, I mean. it belongs to the public! And put in a place where everyone can see it. I will pay top dollar!
052_start_node2=I've heard about one grave. Not a simple grave, the grave of Bonan the Carbarian! Legendary hero of fragments! Princess slayer and monster saver! Or the other way around... No, I was right, he loved monsters very much. What a legend!
052_start_node3=Why you say "plundered"? What a terrible word. You and I... We do archeology! We make excavations! And all what we need is the staff of Bonan. Actually, it is all that he ever had. Including clothes. You know how barbarians are... Yeah... those were strange times.
052_start_node4=Listen to me, we are here not just for fun. We're here to save a valuable relic! The legendary staff of Bonan is simply rotting underground! Hundreds of people could see it here! Just think about the children! They could look at that staff, get inspired of Bonan's labours, and want to be like he waaaa... Actually, I hope not. Because that would not be good. At all.
052_start_transition0_1=I can dig. I can not dig. What is the question?
052_start_transition1_1=Agreed. Prepare the reward!
052_start_transition2_1=Do you want that I plunder the grave? Are you serious?
052_start_transition3_1=It's still stealing. From a grave. Count me out.
052_start_transition3_2=Okay, I'll do it. Where is this grave?
052_start_transition4_1=Okay, if it's for the children...
060_chest_node0=[At first glance, it seems to be an ordinary chest with a copper plate. At second glance, it's not any less ordinary]
060_chest_node1=[At the bottom of the tablet is written the following: "A band of ugly gnarks found some shining gold coins. They decided to divide them into equal parts. If each ugly gnark will take one coin, then one will remain. If each ugly gnark will take two coins, one of them will get no money and other gnarks will make fun of him. How many coins did the ugly gnarks find?"]

060_chest_transition3_1=*@#%&*!!!
060_finish_node0=Wow, you've got my magazines! What a collection! There is even a magazine with a grabber in the center spread...
060_finish_node1=You have rescued a hero from boredom! Take my staff, take anything you want! Now I'll always have something to do.
060_finish_transition0_1=Yes. I have already read some of them. And I'm excited that I still can see after that.
060_finish_transition1_1=Too much information, man.
060_merchant_node0=A new client! Welcome to Belfegarry's Shop! Would you buy some things? Sell? Exchange?
060_merchant_node1=Ah Bonan, you old hooligan... I though you were long dead, but here you are! You haven't changed a bit... Only Bonan ever bought those magazines. I hid them in a secret chest. A special chest, which will be never opened... Because I forgot the password.
060_merchant_transition0_1=I've come to you from Bonan the Carbarian. He needs the magazines "Monsters and little monsters". And I don't know why.
060_merchant_transition1_1=I will try to open it. Who knows, maybe I'll get lucky.
060_start_node0=Who dares disturb me, the great Bonan the Carbarian? Bonan, the great warrior, the brave adventurer, and the hero of all fragments? Even Death itself couldn't kill me!
060_start_node1=Hmm, the staff? Actually, here in the grave I don't need the staff, you're right. Listen, I'll tell you what. I'm so bored laying here that you can't even imagine it. I'll give you the staff if you will get me my lovely magazines "Monsters and little monsters". I know one guy, Belfegarry. He's got to have them.
060_start_node2=Ha-ha! Now you're talking sense! OK, brave one, taste my legendary crushing strike! [Bonan rises from the grave, snapping all of his bones at the same time]
060_start_transition0_1=I am Andrew Gromov, collector and philanthropist. I am interesting for your staff. I want to preserve it, in a museum!
060_start_transition1_1=A monster fan, huh? Okay, I'll find the magazines. Have fun.
060_start_transition1_2=Or I'll challenge you to battle and then take your staff by force. What do you think about that?
060_start_transition2_1=[Accept the battle!]
038_finish_node0=We've got wheels! Now we're a real band! We are ready to rob and kill!
038_finish_node1=[Gnarks look around a little bit stressed] Huh?... Rob? Kill? Is that... cool?
038_finish_transition0_1=It is exactly what I want to talk with you about. Do you wanna be Really Cool?
038_finish_transition1_1=You are really behind on bandit fashion! Modern cool guys do not rob. The coolest guys help the poorest ones! Can you dig it, daddy-o?
038_start_node0=[You are surrounded by few young-like gnarks] *Pst, guys, guys! Get ready, it's like we rehearsed... Robin let's start!* Freeze, punk! Give us all gold you have or we'll make mincemeat outta you!
038_start_node1=[Gnarks look very unsure] Well... Are you a bandit, too? Sorry, excuse us. We didn't know. You seem pretty cool; do you want to join our band? We're still just getting started. We call ourselves "Death on Wheels". And we're a biker gang! But, uh... we have no bikes yet. And no wheels. But we're gonna get them soon. I think. If we can find them.
038_start_transition0_1=Are you sure guys? I believe I will make mincemeat out of you, instead. Grade A Prime. Robin, you'll be first.
038_start_transition1_1=[These guys still can choose the good side...] Let me get you the wheels and then we will talk.
039_finish_node0=[The band has a hot discussion about who was the best at accompanying the old lady through the dangerous forest. Most likely, they all tried to accompany the same old lady, who was terrified by these huge monsters]
039_finish_node1=Will do, boss! We'll become the coolest band in all the shards!
039_finish_transition0_1=That guy really is robbing peasants! I took a part of his "tribute". Split it between poor people and watch for this low-down snake!
039_finish_transition1_1=Sure, you will! How about new ideas for Cool Things to Do?
039_start_node0=Yeah! We want to be Really Cool! Will you teach us?
039_start_node1=I've heard that the head of the neighboring village makes everyone bring him a half of their gold, food and other values. He's got them all scared of him.
039_start_transition0_1=Let's think about it. Do we know of anyone close to us who harms poor and defenseless people?
039_start_transition1_1=A perfect job for our cool band! I'll find out what is going on.
039_village_guy1_node0=Hey stranger! What are you doing in my village? We don't want your kind here!
039_village_guy1_node1=What?.. "Death on Wheels"? What do you want from me? If it is about the new taxes, I give up! I'll cancel all of them!
039_village_guy1_node2=Here! Take everything! It's the last tax collection! Just don't hurt me!
039_village_guy1_node3=I'll return, without fail! Don't hurt me please!
039_village_guy1_transition0_1=The band "Death on wheels" sends you their greetings! From now, people in this village are under our protection.
039_village_guy1_transition1_1=Sure, you will! Or I show you right now why our band is called "Death on Wheels"!
039_village_guy1_transition1_2=No doubt. And you'll return to the people all their money.
039_village_guy1_transition2_1=Good thinking. Don't forget, please! We are always close by!
039_village_guy1_transition3_1=[What a coward...] And remember, we are always nearby and always, always watching!
040_finish_node0=[Your band has a hot discussion about the best way to rescue kittens from trees. At the moment, the most popular suggestion is to throw an axe at the cat, so you see that you have your work cut out for you.]
040_finish_node1=Perfect! Because the peasants from adjacent villages are coughing so hard that we can't understand what they're saying. Man, we are the most famous band in the shard! "Death on wheels" is the best!
040_finish_transition0_1=Hey cool guys! I've got a box with drugs.
040_finish_transition1_1=I'm happy that our gang is successful. Is there something else what I can help our cool band with?
040_start_node0=Gromov, is helping sick people with drugs is a cool thing for our band to do?
040_start_node1=No, no, we are not ready yet! The guys have heard about the wreckage of a flying car. There must be a box with medicine. If you find them, we could share them with sick people. Or something like that.
040_start_transition0_1=Very cool! Have you gotten the medicine?
040_start_transition1_1=I like the way you think, Robin! You're becoming a really cool dude! I will check out that car.
045_finish_node0=[The gnarks share their impressions about good things they did during last day. It sounds pretty decent, actually. These young bandits seem to become local heroes to the peasants.]
045_finish_node1=Wow! So, if we will do good things and charge a small fee, we'll get more than if we robbed them!
045_finish_transition0_1=The problem with blacksmith is solved! Without any fighting, either!. And, by the way, he sends a gift for you - some new equipment.
045_finish_transition1_1=Oh no-no-no! The cool guys don't ask for reward and, what is more important, don't make people pay it! But they gratefully accept presents if the people make it themselves. I hope you'll remember that.
045_start_node0=The peasants told us there is a lazy blacksmith. He doesn't work anymore, so they can't get any new equipment and can't till the fields. We decided to visit him and beat him senseless to motivate him to work again! Yeah! Cool guys forever!
045_start_node1=Hmm. I dunno. Maybe you should ask him why. You know, before beating him senseless?.. [One of gnarks starts to mutter something in Robin's ear. From what you can hear of muttering you understand that, in your absence, they solved nearly half of all problems this way]
045_start_transition0_1=Wait a minute, guys. Beating him senseless? At least, figure out his reasons!
045_start_transition1_1=Oh my God... OK, I'll find out what is the problem with this blacksmith.
050_dead_node0=[You see an unmoving blue chicken. Probably sleeping. Hopefully.]
050_dead_node1=[The wind ruffles the chicken's feathers and you see that they are not completely blue. The chicken seems to have been white originally.
050_dead_node2=[The chicken doesn't react. It seems we have bad news]
050_dead_transition0_1=[Poke the chicken with a stick]
050_dead_transition1_1=It's painted! So, I must find a chicken and a painter!
050_dead_transition2_1=I need new blue chicken... This bird seems to be very rare.
050_finish_node0=My Blueing! It seems to have gotten little smaller? Oh, I'm sure it wouldn't eat without me... Nice to see you again, my friend!
050_finish_node1=Of course! Now, Blueing and I will work much better! Here is a small reward from me. As token of my appreciation.
050_finish_transition0_1=Whew! So now you'll return to work?
050_finish_transition1_1=Take care of your Blueing! And uh... don't bathe it, please. You know, just to be safe.
050_start_node0=O woe, o woe is me! How can I go on now? And more importantly - why?
050_start_node1=My sky-blue noble breed bird! I love my bird so much, but one day it just ...went away! And now I can't work, I can't eat, I can't live! How can I go on without my Blueing?
050_start_node2=I just can't work! My Blueing... My only joy... Is gone...
050_start_transition0_1=Are you OK? I've heard you aren't doing much work anymore. What happened?!
050_start_transition1_1=I'll try to find it, OK? We can't let you go on this way. We will return your Blueing.
050_start_transition2_1=Who is Blueing?
051_finish_node0=You've got the paint. And the chicken! The last one was bigger... but I think this one is also OK. Let's get this secret process going!
051_finish_node1=Hmm... Since then I've gotten better. Now my work is much more polished! For instance, if we add some red highlights... Ooh, and a yellow half moon on the forehead...Hmm hm hmm...
051_finish_node2=[The painter looks annoyed] With the highlights, it will look even more spectacular. But I understand that it's hard for average, ordinary, boring people to understand my great ideas. There, done. A very blue bird. As requested! [The freshly painted chicken looks dazed]
051_finish_transition0_1=Try to do everything just like last time.
051_finish_transition1_1=No highlights and no half moons! It must be exactly the same chicken!
051_finish_transition2_1=Wonderful! And not a word to blacksmith about our little plan!
051_start_node0=[He's got a weary look and paint-splattered clothes. He's definitely a painter.]
051_start_node1=I am Colorman, at your service! The best painter of all shards! Actually... I've never met other painters, so I'm sticking to my story.
051_start_node2=It is strange that you would mention that. Generally speaking, yes. And I've already worked on that. Once I played a trick on my friend and gave him what was supposedly a very rare blue bird... Ha-ha, it was very funny! Apparently he believed me.
051_start_node3=Ouch. Awkward. So, the blacksmith is unhappy now? We must help him by all means... Unfortunately, I have no more blue paint. I even paint the sky green. Everybody thinks that I'm an avant-garde painter.
051_start_node4=Oh, it's not so hard. You need to collect blue berries, crush them, mix a little bit, then slightly heat 'em up... Here's the recipe. Get me paint and I'll do it.
051_start_transition0_1=Hello! I need the best painter around. Is that you?
051_start_transition1_1=Could you paint... a chicken?
051_start_transition2_1=Yeah, he believed you, and how! And now that it's dead, he can't imagine his life without that blue chicken. So, you gotta do it again.
051_start_transition3_1=No, a green chicken is not what I need. So where I can find the blue paint?
051_start_transition4_1=Perfect. I’ll be back soon!
B01_start_node0=My friend, if you believe that old Willy could be useful for you - you are right! I examined your robots and have many ideas how to improve their weapons. You have enough scrap metal, but if you will help me with some explosives, I could build here the real armory! And prices will beat any of the competition.
B01_start_transition0_1=Great idea, Willy!
B01_finish_node0=[The old sheriff diligently cleans his revolver that is already shining in the sun]
B01_finish_node1="Willy's Armory" is open! Welcome!
B01_finish_transition0_1=I've collected everything you need!
B01_finish_transition0_2=[Not enough resources]
B01_finish_transition1_1=Great news!
B02_start_node0=Gromov, I have new examples of the deadly weapon! Do you wanna look?
B02_start_transition0_1=[Trade]
B03_start_node0=Gromov, I've been looking for ways to optimize your inventions. And I have a perfect solution. I can try to upgrade your weapon, and improve its stats. I'll try to exchange some materials, tighten this, lubricate that... A little bit of reforging... The performance can always be improved. When you bring me some power units for my lab, I can do it.
B03_start_transition0_1=Let's try!
B03_finish_node0=[The engineer looks skeptically on your buildings and workbenches. His eyes tell you that he would have done it all in a completely different way]
B03_finish_node1=So, everything is ready! If you wanna upgrade your weapons - come to me!
B03_finish_transition0_1=All required resources have been collected!
B03_finish_transition0_2=[Not enough resources]
B03_finish_transition1_1=Perfect!
B04_start_node0=I could try to upgrade any of your weapons. It can be risky, I can't guarantee a positive result with reforging. But if it's successful, fighting will be a breeze.
B04_start_transition0_1=[Start the reforging]
B05_start_node0=Do you remember that I am a native researcher? If I stay here I could share with you my maps of all the secret shards. Completely unknown! Mysteries, treasures, new adventures - all for you! All I need is a few gems to travel between shards.
B05_start_transition0_1=Sounds interesting.
B05_finish_node0=[The experienced wanderer muses upon a distant scene. It seems his mind is far, far away from here. Based on his smile, the place must be full of treasure.]
B05_finish_node1=It's great! Now, I'm ready to share my findings with you! There are so many undiscovered spots around the world!
B05_finish_transition0_1=I've collected enough gems!
B05_finish_transition0_2=[Not enough resources]
B05_finish_transition1_1=I look forward to it!
B06_start_node0=My dear Gromov, are you ready for new projects? Tomas Frederic Melton can offer only the most risky and dangerous adventures!
B06_start_transition0_1=[Trade]
004_finish_node0=[The writer continues his work, unaware of anything around him. The sheer amount of crumpled sheets from his notebook is impressive]
004_finish_node1=Terrible! I should burn this cursed notebook right now! I even haven't started writing the climax of the book - the unstoppable apocalypse! What a mercy that I should meet you and not have to continue this awful charade!
004_finish_node2=What? Notebook? Hmm... I do not even remember... very strange. Everything is a fog... Maybe it was always mine? Or not?
004_finish_node3=On the napkins, there is nothing else... Wait a moment, it's coming back tome... I found this notebook here at the cemetery! In one of crypts! I don't know why, but I decided to write my novel right there, inside! Why, is it important?
004_finish_transition0_1=Where did you get this notebook?
004_finish_transition1_1=Just for your information: next time, when you find cursed items - just leave them be, OK?
004_finish_transition2_1=Try to remember! Before you lived near the cemetery, where did you write your book?
004_finish_transition3_1=It's not just a notebook, this is the Book of the Dead. And everything what you write in it is coming true. That's why all these poor devils have come back to life at the cemetery.
004_start_node0=[The sad stranger writes something in his notebook speaking in his beard. Sometimes he curses, furiously snatches and crumples a page, and continues to work]
004_start_node1=[Surprised, the stranger drops the notebook on the floor] Oh! You scared me! Do you usually sneak up on artists who immerse themselves in their work?
004_start_node2=I am creator of worlds and fates! I am lord of the time and events! I... Actually, I'm just a writer. And right now I am working on my most important book - a future bestseller! That's why I live here, close to quiet cemetery, so that no one can disturb me. But it turns out there are distractions, after all. First, these insane screams at nights, now you... I'll never finish this book!
004_start_node3=Interesting? I must tell you that there are worst work conditions! Ah, but maybe you will help me. The first couple days were very silent and calm. But then, something terrible came to the cemetery. Whatever it is, it's loud! If you can figure out what it is and get it to stop, I'll be able to continue my book. Oh, and give you a reward. Do you want to be a secondary character that will die in the third chapter? Say the word, and I'll attempt to memorize your name!
004_start_transition0_1=Hello?
004_start_transition1_1=And what is so important about your work?
004_start_transition2_1=Insane screams? It sounds like something ...interesting.
004_start_transition3_1=I prefer gold. Okay, Let's see what's going on at your cemetery.
004_zombie_node0=S-s-s-tooop! D-o-on't ki-i-ill! [The words wake an old zombie].
004_zombie_node1=It is a-a-all because of that fa-a-at blue jee-eerr-k! Why does he wa-aa-ke us-s-s u-up, again and again? The Book of the Dead should no-o-ot be written i-in! Not by-y him, not by a-aa-anyo-one!
004_zombie_transition0_1=Finally, someone intelligent! You! Tell me what is happening here.
004_zombie_transition1_1=The Book of the Dead? Now I have a few questions for the writer...
005_first_report_node0=[The inventor is continuously kicking a large bomb and giggling like a crazy person. You start thinking that these experiments could turn out pretty bad.]
005_first_report_node1=Too weak? Hmm, that's not right... Give me a minute, I'll check my calculations...
005_first_report_node2=Done! I've improved the recipe. I did many measures and calculations, calculated the critical mass, corrected the length of detonator... Frankly, I'm not sure what will happen. I need to test the new recipe on the spiders. It must be perfect!
005_first_report_transition0_1=I tested mine No. 128. It's too weak - it can't kill harm a fly!
005_first_report_transition1_1=[Wait]
005_first_report_transition2_1=Let's try it!
005_give_saltpeter_node0=What now, you need more ingredients again? Take it, I have plenty.
005_give_saltpeter_transition0_1=Thank you!
005_second_report_node0=[The inventor strikes the rocket with a hammer and it makes a dangerous-sounding beep. And even the smallest beeping sound coming from the rocket after striking it with a hammer would have seemed extremely dangerous]
005_second_report_node1=It means that it's not a mine, man! The mine must BLOW UP! Understood? Yes. Here is the last one. I'm sure now it's fine. And don't waste time on spiders or birds... Try it on a grabber. It must work perfectly!
005_second_report_transition0_1=The experiment didn't work. It's strange, but for some reason your mine made the spiders stronger.
005_second_report_transition1_1=If it would make the grabbers stronger, I'll bring it to you.
005_start_node0=[On huge pile of lead, metal parts, and fragments of rockets sits a gnark, which picks at a big antipersonnel mine with a screwdriver.]
005_start_node1=Is it gonna blow? Yes, that's the whole point, it MUST blow up! This is the mine! And I am the creator of mines, rockets, bombs, and everything that makes HUGE BOOMS! If you want to help me, don't stay here - take this new recipe of mine, No. 128, put it together, and test it on some birds. There are a couple nests near here. I'm sure I'll hear it if it works right.
005_start_transition0_1=Be careful, it can blow up!
005_start_transition1_1=Umm... Okay, let's try it.
005_third_report_node0=Ha-ha! I've could tell from here how great it was! Cool! I would give you more, but it seems that we have blown up the unique crystal -- my only one -- into fragments. I heard that the collector -- the one I stole it from -- whine about it "Boo hoo, I lost the rare, one of a kind crystal..." What a weenie. Okay, as thanks for your help, here are some simple mines. Still powerful! And when you use them up, here's the recipe to make new ones.
005_third_report_transition0_1=Thank you!
004_story_1_node0="It was so silent around that Alan could clearly hear his heartbeat. He knew that, in spite of the silence, someone was watching him. 'I know you are here!' screamed Alan. 'You don't scare me!' That was a mistake. Because that was no fearless wanderer they saw. It was dinner. They closed in."
004_story_1_transition0_1=...
004_story_2_node0="Shocked, Alan ran through the old cemetery, crashing through the dense underbrush. Suddenly, a terrifying howl filled the night air. He stopped and tried to understand where this sound was coming from. He felt a terrible foreboding. The sound couldn't be avoided. It was coming from everywhere. And whatever was making it had him surrounded..."
004_story_2_transition0_1=...
004_story_3_node0="Alan's heart was beating furiously as he ran, far away from this cursed cemetery and its inhabitants. The exit was so close, so close, fewer than fifty steps. From Alan's chest escaped a hoarse, mad laughter. He is the dangerous one! He escaped! He is invinci-- KRAK! A powerful blow threw Alan to the ground. In his last moment, he turned to see what attacked him. But the last thing he saw was a spiked ball on the longest chain flying straight toward his face.

B07_start_node0=Drogkh is a great hunter! Drogkh can exchange his trophies with you. If you are hunter too!
B07_start_transition0_1=I can prove it.

B07_finish_node1=Drogkh is obliged to you. Now, Drogkh won't drop bones and skulls in your home anymore. Drogkh will trade!

B08_start_transition0_1=[Trade]
B09_start_node0=You rescued me, so I want to pay you back. I can make potions and other things. If you want I can make them for you. All I need is a place where I could perform my experiments, and then I'd be all set!
B09_start_transition0_1=Great plan!
B09_finish_node0=[Victoria sings quietly while sewing up a tear in her suit. It seems she likes this place]

B11_start_transition0_1=OK, thanks!
R01_start_node0=Welcome to the bloodiest arena in all the shards! If you want to test yourself, great warrior - be ready for the match-up of your life! Here we only accept warriors taller than five meters!
R01_start_node1=Agreed! Let the battle begin!
R01_start_transition0_1=I'm ready to fight!
R01_start_transition0_2=I'm not quite ready to fight.

R01_finish_transition0_1=Thank you!
056_finish_node0=The human brought a leopard! [The robot presses some button and from its belly comes some odd music. It seems to be a strange, but effective, way to show its happiness]
056_finish_node1=The human rescued the robots. The rabbits menace us no longer!
056_finish_transition0_1=The leopard is yours! The key is to not forget to feed it, walk it, and scratch its neck. It loves affection.
056_finish_transition1_1=Bye, pal! Have a good time with the robots, and catch lots of rabbits for them! >sniff<
056_start_node0=Human! The whole factory is occupied by rabbits. The mechanical life forms are in danger. After detailed analysis of the situation, we see only one obvious solution: We need a domestic leopard.
056_start_node1=A wild leopard would be too dangerous for all life forms. We need a special tame rabbit slayer. Nearby we detected a troll, which is training the leopards. The possibility that this will work for us is equal to: 92%.
056_start_transition0_1=You don't want me to introduce my leopard to you, do you?
056_start_transition1_1=Stay away from the rabbits or I'll bring the leopard!
056_talk_with_bars_node0=[The leopard growls with mistrust, and the hair on its neck stands on end]

056_talk_with_bars_transition1_1=[Give the meat to the leopard and kindly scratch its neck when it's eating]
056_talk_with_troll_node0=I am Tronglo. I am from the Clan of Ice Backs. What do you need, stranger?
056_talk_with_troll_node1=The leopards choose themselves who they want to be with. You must show it your bravery, your kindness, and most importantly, its food. If the leopard is satisfied, it will obey you.
056_talk_with_troll_node2=I have one. Very kind. Very dangerous. His fangs are like knifes. His claws are like daggers. His personality is like a dove. If it goes with you, he will be perfect.
056_talk_with_troll_transition0_1=I need a domestic leopard. A special one - for hunt rabbits.
056_talk_with_troll_transition1_1=It's almost clear. Let's try it!
056_talk_with_troll_transition2_1=What do you mean "if he goes"? Could he not want to go?
057_finish_node0=There are no more rabbits. What have you done, human?
057_finish_node1=The very idea that machine oil could cause damage! According to our information, machine oil is very useful! But if this is what you wish, we will recycle the oil and not just pour out it on the ground.
057_finish_transition0_1=The Forest Brotherhood will stop the "furry intervention" if you will keep the shard clean. Your machine oil hurts nature. Come on, robots, share the planet!
057_finish_transition1_1=Yes, it would be very nice of you. It’s done!
057_start_node0=According to our calculation, the population of rabbits can't grow so much in such a short time period. So, the possibility of an external intervention is equal to 99%. You must find the reason why the rabbits are here and fix it.
057_start_node1=Objects' analysis for last two weeks. Rabbits: 250 items. Insects: 12,275 items. Gromov: 1 item. Furry red stranger: 1 item.
057_start_transition0_1=Any ideas? Perhaps, there was someone strange on the shard?
057_start_transition1_1=Exactly, this red furry stranger is most interesting to me...
063_finish_node0=Request: digital lockpicks.
063_finish_node1=Accepted. Now, I must solve the problem with toxic liquid.
063_finish_transition0_1=Answer: here are your lockpicks.
063_finish_transition1_1=And how we will solve it?
063_start_node0=First task: open the gate. Availability of required tools: negative.
063_start_node1=Request: digital lockpicks. You must find them to go through the gate. Approximate location of lockpicks: calculating coordinates...
063_start_transition0_1=Something is missing?
063_start_transition1_1=[Start search]
064_finish_node0=Request: solving the problem with acid.
064_finish_node1=Decision is made. Last question is left.
064_finish_transition0_1=I've got real fisherman's rubber boots!
064_finish_transition1_1=What else have we got?
064_start_node0=You need an anti-acid protection. Analyzing possible solutions. Quantum teleportation. Acid immunity. Titanium prosthesis instead of legs. Rubber foots.
064_start_node1=The choice is made: get the boots. The logic is weif, because it seems to me the quantum teleportation is more dangerous and interesting. Oh well. According to our data, the one owner of rubber boots is some creature that is engaged in a strange process of lowering a rope into the water to catch some water inhabitants.
064_start_transition0_1=One thing's for sure - we won't make a prosthesis. The boots are the best option!
064_start_transition1_1=Probably you mean the fisherman. I think you need to find him.
065_finish_node0=Request: high-quality oil.
065_finish_node1=Truth test: completed. We believe you! Are you ready to open the gate?
065_finish_transition0_1=Answer: you may not believe it, but I've got some oil for you!
065_finish_transition1_1=I'm ready!
065_start_node0=Request: high-quality oil. It is required to lubricate the bunker's door.
065_start_node1=Our oil is spoiled. We need the fresh stuff. Recommendation: visit the troll-nomads' home. They've collected a large amount of items from different shards. There's like a 75% chance they have the good oil.
065_start_transition0_1=Wouldn't the regular machine oil be OK?
065_start_transition1_1=It will be done!
066_finish_node0=Defying all expectations, the task is completed!
066_finish_node1=The human deserves the recognition of all robots and our most valuable reward! Thank you, human!
066_finish_transition0_1=You didn't believe me, did you, rust bucketl?
066_finish_transition1_1=Be safe!

066_gates_transition0_2=[Use digital lockpicks]
066_gates_transition1_1=[Exit to the Main menu]
066_reservoir_node0=[You are standing behind a closed door. The door is rusty enough that you can see large claw marks on it]
066_reservoir_node1=[The rest of the paint is now dripping from the door]
066_reservoir_transition0_1=[Kick the door]
066_reservoir_transition0_2=[Oil the door hinges]
066_reservoir_transition1_1=[Kick the door again, twice]
066_start_node0=First task: go through the gate. Second task: go through the toxic liquid. Third task: oil the door of the bunker.
066_start_node1=We'll do the rest. You must help us by completing these three tasks.
066_start_transition0_1=It doesn't look too hard.
066_start_transition1_1=Let's start!
058_finish_node0=Enough! You have the upper hand and I can't stop you. But just listen to me! These robots are killing everything!
058_finish_node1=It makes no difference to me if they are peaceful or not! Their machine oil drips everywhere, and it's destroying nature! Flowers, herbs, trees, animals - they're all dying!
058_finish_transition0_1=Killing? They're peaceful!
058_finish_transition1_1=And you decided to kill them all?
058_start_node0=Don't distract me! Don't you see I'm in the middle of a furry intervention? Come ON!
058_start_node1=Of course, they are mine! Who else can stop these robots? Nobody except me!
058_start_node2=So, you are on their side, right? And you think you have nothing to fear from the rabbits. Well, now you will see nature's true power!
058_start_transition0_1=Furry intervention? Are all these rabbits your doing?
058_start_transition1_1=The robots haven't done anything wrong. You have to stop this!
058_start_transition2_1=What is your problem?
059_finish_node0=Did you clean up the shard? Is the oil gone?
059_finish_node1=Well done! [The fox throws the oil into the portal with disgust] I'm stopping my furry intervention! But tell those robots that if I ever see another oil drop - they will never see the ground again, there will be so many rabbits!
059_finish_transition0_1=Whew! All oil collected!
059_finish_transition1_1=Okay, I'll tell them.
059_start_node0=This is the only way! How else could it work?
059_start_node1=I agree! I don't believe in words, I believe in actions! Listen to me, if you will clean up the oil on this shard, and tell the robots to stop leaving it everywhere, then I'll stop my "intervention" and take the rabbits back!
059_start_transition0_1=I don't know, maybe negotiate with them! Huh? Ever thought of that?
059_start_transition1_1=Agreed!
053_finish_node0=Have you got the tools? The beeping is getting louder and louder. That's a very bad sign!!
053_finish_node1=Incredible! I guess it crawled in there while I was charging. That is ...very strange. Thank you for solving my problem, human!
053_finish_node2=Open the body, quickly! It's gonna blow any second!
053_finish_node3=What is it? Is it a bomb? Is it big? Very big? Humongous?
053_finish_transition0_1=I have the tools. What should I do?
053_finish_transition1_1=No problem! Be careful with your new pet.
053_finish_transition2_1=Okay, here we go! Don't move... [Carefully open the body]
053_finish_transition3_1=You're not going to believe this but... it's a rabbit. A little furry bunny! And for some reason, it... is beeping very loudly.
053_start_node0=[This robot is moving strangely, like something is wrong] Human! You must help me! This is urgent!
053_start_node1=The problem is very serious. Something is beeping inside of my body. I think it's a bomb. I can't believe I'm saying this, but you have to take me apart and defuse it! Judging by how loud the beeping is, it could destroy everything in a two-mile radius!
053_start_transition0_1=What happened?!
053_start_transition1_1=Yikes! I'll get some tools!
054_finish_node0=[The robot can't talk and only utters loud clanking. Upon seeing you, the robot starts clanking away like mad and pointing at its head with its one working manipulator]
054_finish_node1=[The robot nods with terrifying clank]
054_finish_transition0_1=Where should I pour the oil? Like, directly... in you mouth?
054_finish_transition1_1=[Pour the oil in]
054_start_node0=Hu->skrss-skk<-man! He->skkrss<-elp me. I need >skrss-ss< oil, quickly!
054_start_node1=Now, it is >skrss< worse. All my parts >skrss< are now covered with a strange moss. If you >skrsrsss< don't lubricate me immediately, I'll become >sksss< a useless pile of bolts!
054_start_transition0_1=Are you rusted?
054_start_transition1_1=Wait here! It should be easy, since you can't even move...
055_dead_robot_node0=[You see little robot in a smoking wreck. It can't be salvaged.]
055_dead_robot_node1=[Judging by the remains of the blown-up robot covered with a green stuff, it was troll-shaman with his healing potion once again. But now -- miraculously -- I have the parts I need.]
055_dead_robot_transition0_1=I think the robot doesn't need them anymore...
055_dead_robot_transition1_1=That nice troll is bad for robots... [Take necessary parts]
055_finish_node0=[The robot is going downhill fast. There is something short-circuiting inside it]
055_finish_node1=[The robot is trying to express joy, but it's hard when you're burning inside because a nice shaman poured potion into your circuitry]
055_finish_node2=[Swapping those parts definitely helped. The robot looks deformed, but functional] I'm operational again! Thank you, human! You are a real robot saver!
055_finish_transition0_1=I've got the parts! I'll fix you right up.
055_finish_transition1_1=[Change the damaged parts of the robot]
055_finish_transition2_1=You’re always welcome!
055_start_node0=[You see a smoking robot that seems to be sparking inside its frame. It seems to need help.]
055_start_node1=It was an accident... I was charging my battery when the troll that went near to me decided that I'm dying. He poured some green liquid in me and said: "With this potion, you will quickly recover, strange animal." This liquid corroded the battery and damaged the security module! If I don't get new parts I'll fall to pieces!
055_start_transition0_1=Are you OK?
055_start_transition1_1=I’ll bring new parts.
066_gates_transition0_3=(Leave)
066_reservoir_transition0_3=(Leave)
067_finish_node0=[The troll respectfully tilts his head] You have won. Now you are the strongest warrior, and from now on we will call you Remover! You deserve to be the chief of our horde!
067_finish_node1=[The troll looks surprised] Does the horde not deserve your power? This is very sad! We will train more diligently to become as strong as you. Take anything you want as a reward, Remover.
067_finish_transition0_1=Thanks, but... Just give me the oil.
067_finish_transition1_1=Thank you! And please say hello from me to other parts of your horde.
067_start_node0=[The extremely big troll is concentrating on mining his nasal cavity]
067_start_node1=[The troll looks you up and down] Battle. If you defeat the strongest warrior, the reward is all yours.
067_start_transition0_1=Sorry for disturbing you. Do you have machine oil?
067_start_transition1_1=I knew it...
pack_random_get_item_finish_node0=You did it! Take your reward!
pack_random_get_item_finish_transition0_1=Thank you!
pack_random_get_item_notready_node0=If you have nothing for me, we have nothing to talk about.
pack_random_get_item_notready_transition0_1=(Leave)
pack_random_get_item_notready_fail_node0=Did you get everything I need?
pack_random_get_item_notready_fail_transition0_1=Not yet! (Leave)
pack_random_get_item_quest_node0=Do you need some work? If you bring me {{targetCount}} {{targetName}}, I'll pay you for it.
pack_random_get_item_quest_transition0_1=Consider it done!
pack_random_get_item_quest_transition0_2=No thanks.
pack_random_get_item_run_node0=Courier needed! Deliver the bag - take the money!
pack_random_get_item_run_transition0_1=Sounds easy. Be ready to pay.
100_start_node2=NO, I DO NOT MEAN MONEY!!
100_start_transition2_1=D-do I have to battle to the death every time??
100_speak_after_fight_transition1_2=Well, you can keep waiting.
121_start_node0=>Sssk< ... >crrk< -nyone there? >skkssk<
121_start_node1=>skkssk< ...romov! Gromov! You made it! Buddy, I thought we were goners! Where are you?
121_start_node2=Man, you must have gotten klonked on the head pretty hard! Don't you remember, man? It's me, Dave!
121_start_node3=I got thrown free when the plane broke apart. I landed in a forest somewhere and I'm banged up but in a safe place. I'll be okay once I rest a little. Frankly, I... don't know how I'm still alive.
121_start_node4=The signal is strongest when I go to the south, so I'm thinking you would need to come north to find me--
121_start_node5=Wait, wait! Don't be so hasty! Have you seen the kinds of monsters that are in this place? If you come straight here, you'll be eaten faster than you can say, "No, no, please don't eat me!"
121_start_node6=To be perfectly honest, I don't think we're in France, Europe, or even Earth anymore! We need to figure out what's going on, how to survive, and then how to get home.
121_start_node7=I'm safe here, so make yourself safe there. Get the supplies you need from the surrounding areas, then we can start figuring out how to meet up.
121_start_node8=Yeah, I was your co-pilot. We were on a test run. Something about an experimental engine. It's a little fuzzy. I think we've got bigger fish to fry here.
121_start_transition0_1=What? A radio-- could it still be working after that crash? And who could be calling me -- OHH my head! Hello? Hello? Do you read me? This is Gromov!
121_start_transition1_1=Well, I'm -- I'm right by the plane, but before I ask WHERE you are, uh... WHO are you?
121_start_transition2_1=Dave? Ohh, wow, yeah, I'm a little confused right now. You're my ... co-pilot, right? Where are you?
121_start_transition3_1=Well, the radio still works, so we have to be within range. How can I find you?
121_start_transition3_2=Hold on a second. I need to get the story straight. You and I were flying the plane, right...?
121_start_transition4_1=Okay, I-I'm coming. I'll be right there!
121_start_transition5_1=[continue]
121_start_transition6_1=Okay, so what do I do?
121_start_transition7_1=Okay, solid plan!
121_start_transition8_1=[continue]
121_in_airplane_node0=[You've made it safely inside the fuselage of the plane. The monster beats on the outside mercilessly while you cower in the cockpit. In front of you are an array of switches, throttles, and buttons, and there appears to be a tiny bit of gas in the tank and juice in the battery.]
121_in_airplane_node1=[DOINK! The landing gear pops out and boops the monster in the nose. The monster is surprised, annoyed, and confused, but not hurt. It continues to bash the plane.]
121_in_airplane_node2=[WUBBA WUBBA WAP WAP! The flaps and ailerons of the wings gently caress the monster on its ears and tail. It is highly irritated and puts a sizable dent in the top of the plane.]
121_in_airplane_node3=[KA-CHOOM! The undamaged right engine turns over, something inside it explodes with force that tears off the wing, smashing the monster in the face, and knocking it down for the count. You're safe. Nice work!]
121_in_airplane_transition0_1=[Activate the landing gear.]
121_in_airplane_transition0_2=[Wiggle the control stick and the pedals.]
121_in_airplane_transition0_3=[Hit the ignition.]
121_in_airplane_transition1_1=[try something else]
121_in_airplane_transition2_1=[try something else]
121_in_airplane_transition3_1=Hmm. It sure is less stressful to beat on monsters when I'm safe inside some sort of armor. I'll have to think about this...
121_after_win_node0=>shhkkss< Gromov! I've got huge news! I've accomplished something AMAZING that could really change everything for us. But first, how are you? What are you up to?
121_after_win_node1=*long silence* Hmm. That's way better than my thing. I just started a fire and cooked a fish. Well, anyway, nice work! What are you going to do now?
121_after_win_node2=Hold on a second. How about both? Being armored and invulnerable PLUS having the smashing powers? That would be amazing. You wouldn't be afraid of anything! You could walk all over this monster world!
121_after_win_node3=Ah! I think I know this! There are some obelisks around this world that the monsters don't go close to. So you could have a pretty safe area to work!
121_after_win_transition0_1=Uh, well, I just knocked out a giant monster by hiding in our plane, and then smashing the engine and the wing into its face!
121_after_win_transition1_1=I had the idea that I'm going to start gathering up some lumber and metal and see if I can't armor myself so that I can be safe walking through the monster-infested lands around here.
121_after_win_transition1_2=I'm thinking that I want to make some smashing weapons so that I can crush the skulls of any creature that looks at me funny.
121_after_win_transition2_1=Say, you're right! Let me see if I can find a safe place to get materials together and build something. If only I knew where it would be safe.
121_after_win_transition3_1=I think I saw one to the north of here. Thanks, Dave, I'll talk to you soon!
122_after_build_node0=>skkssk< Gromov, you there? It's Dave again. I've got big news. Listen, buddy, I don't think we're on the same world.
122_after_build_node1=This world-- it's made of all these bits and pieces and people and creatures that have been pulled from all over the universe. But they haven't all stuck together like a planet. It's like they're chunks, all orbiting around something at the center.
122_after_build_node2=That's the thing. With the way these orbits work, sometimes we swing close to each other, and the reception's good, and some times we're far away, and the reception's bad. Sometimes we're even completely blocked from each other and we can't communicate at all!
122_after_build_node3=Silver lining, mon ami. You know the portal that's near the black obelisk in the base you've made? It doesn't work, right? Well, I did some experimenting on mine here, and it just needs a couple things to make it work: a green gem, a little glue, and a stick. Even jury-rigged together like that it'll get you from world to world. Then we can start figuring out how to meet up.
122_after_build_node4=Real funny. You've been building goliaths, not studying the stars.
122_after_build_node5=Who knows? Something powerful and dark. I can't see it in the sky.
122_after_build_transition0_1=Whaaaa...?
122_after_build_transition0_2=Get with the program, Dave. I figured that out a long time ago.
122_after_build_transition1_1=But how can we communicate by radio if we're on different uh... chunks?
122_after_build_transition1_2=What's at the center?
122_after_build_transition2_1=Aw, for crying out loud! I spent all this time building a big armored walking robot thing to get to you, and you're not even on the same world...?
122_after_build_transition2_2=I was wondering why you weren't answering my calls.
122_after_build_transition3_1=Yeah, I know where those things are. Okay, I'll get to work on it right away.
122_after_build_transition4_1=[continue]
122_after_build_transition5_1=Oh well, it's probably not important. We should put it out of our minds. So is this why our radio reception is so wonky?
089_dont_understand_gnarks_node2=Gnark?
089_dont_understand_gnarks_transition0_2=Gnarkety gnark gnark?
089_dont_understand_gnarks_transition2_1=Yeah, gnarky gnark!
089_gnarks_leader_final_node2=Make sure? How would they make sure?
089_gnarks_leader_final_node3=Human, you have no more honor than the Forgers. Very well, we will take the offer. If you can accept the weight of that, then so be it.
089_gnarks_leader_final_transition2_1=I-I don't know. I'm uh... just the messenger. I'm sorry.
089_gnarks_leader_final_transition3_1=Well, that sucked.
087_heal_indiana_node0=GROWF! GRAAK! RRrrg... Pleashe... Don't attack...I mean ...no harm. Need help. Need healing. Turned into beast. Please... help.
087_heal_indiana_node1=Hrrgh. [creature breathes easier, and his form morphs slowly into a human adventurer in torn clothes]
087_heal_indiana_transition0_1=Yes, I have a health kit here. Hold still and I'll help you. [apply health kit to creature]
087_heal_indiana_transition0_2=I don't have a health kit, but hold tight and I'll go get one.
087_heal_indiana_transition0_3=Too bad for you, chum. [attack the creature]
087_heal_indiana_transition1_1=There you go.
087_take_indiana_to_base_node0=Ohhh... where am I? Oh, that's right. I... I was exploring these Caves. I saw the Stone. I touched it-- it seemed so easy to bring it back, but...s-something happened. I-I can't remember... Oh! My clothes-- they're torn!
087_take_indiana_to_base_node1=Wh-what? How long? Minutes? Hours?
087_take_indiana_to_base_node2=Oh. What do I do now?
087_take_indiana_to_base_transition0_1=Mister, I have some bad news for you. You've been transformed into a ravenous monster for a long time. Probably caused by that Stone you touched.
087_take_indiana_to_base_transition1_1=More like months. People have given up looking for you because the beast in these caves -- you -- was so terrifying.
087_take_indiana_to_base_transition2_1=Come with me, man. I'll get you back. [grab stone with Goliath's hands]
107_start_node2=Heh. Well, I told you the bad news. The good news is this. [hands you a piece of paper]
107_start_transition2_1=Let me see, what is this...?
107_take_to_base_node0=You did it! Look, kid. What if... I want to join your team? What do you think?
107_take_to_base_transition0_1=Sure, come along! I'd love to have some help crafting and operating machinery.
107_take_to_base_transition0_2=I dunno, T1NK3R3R, I move a lot faster by myself. Maybe later.
107_finish_transition0_2=Sorry, I forgot that's what we'd been talking about. Nope, I'm a lone wolf. Grr!
123_start_node0=Drogkh is free now. Drogkh is a great hunter! Drogkh wants to help.
123_start_node1=Drogkh agreed. Drogkh is looking for the old tribe in foreign land for many moons, it's gone. Drogkh has a new tribe now!
123_start_transition0_1=The help will never hurt. We can travel together!
123_start_transition1_1=Welcome to new tribe, Drogkh.
124_start_node0=Knight Olivia is at your command, sir! You are the first human whom I've met in those magic lands!
124_start_node1=I'll be honored, sir. My sword will be useful for you.
124_start_transition0_1=We must hold together if we want to get out of here.
124_start_transition1_1=Welcome to the team, knight!
125_start_node0=You are a human! Thank God! I've almost believed that I will stay here between these beast to the end of my life!
125_start_node1=Of course, in this suit! Call me Baroness Victoria! Model, cosplayer, and geek. By the way, do you have a phone? I must tell everybody as soon as possible that this festival is an absolutely catastrophe!
125_start_transition0_1=Are you a pirate?
125_start_transition1_1=So many surprises are waiting for you, Baroness Victoria. I'll bring you to a safe place and there you will see the situation.
118_prepare_to_build_tp_1_node0=The foundation of the teleport. We need 50 iron ingots and 10 meteor ingots to build it.

016_start_node0=Stop! The entrance into the city is closed! You can enter if you're a trader or have a personal invite from Bloody Willy!
016_start_node1=You are trader, yeah? And what is you guild certificate, you trader? You are a cheater! Do you know what we do with the cheaters in our city?
016_start_node2=What a stupid question! Of course, in the trade guild! Now, go away from here and stop spending my time!
016_start_transition0_1=What a luck! I am exactly the trader. And I have been invited. Could I enter?
016_start_transition1_1=[Leave]
016_start_transition2_1=Guild certificate? I've lost it for a while. Remind me please where I could get another one?
017_finish_node0=You did it! My son... It's open again!
017_finish_node1=Sure, sure! Just a moment, we'll find a letter and seal for you... Hey you, son of a golem! This grabber also ate my seal! Know what? I give you an expired certificate. It is expired, for sure, and there is my name... But it's true! If you want something - always welcome. From now, our trade will go on!
017_finish_transition0_1=Can I join the guild now?
017_finish_transition1_1=Thank you... [You see a name on the certificate] Arzadonald the Great? Well, OK...
017_start_node0=[Blue-skin giant with golden pin "Guild master" is staying at entrance to the market and hardly groaning. From behind the gate are heard terrifying roar, wallop, and champing]
017_start_node1=[The trader blows up] Everybody wanted to join the guild! And we accepted everybody! But then came this idiot, egg trader! Selling dront's eggs? OK! Spider's eggs - welcome! But he brought a grabber's egg here... And now this insatiable beast is pipped! It lives on my market. There are so many goods that it couldn't eat for entire life, and it's farming! Well, if you defeat the grabber - we will talk.
017_start_node2=The guild? Where do you see the guild, boy? There is no guild anymore. As well as no trade. My market is also gone! So, go away until you can.
017_start_transition0_1=Here is the place where I could join the trade guild?
017_start_transition1_1=Wait here. Let see what a grabber you have.
017_start_transition2_1=I must join the guild! What happened?
018_chest_node0=Hand off from the chest! It is the property of Bloody Willy!

018_daemon_node0=My dear friend! How can I help you?
018_daemon_node1=Gnarks, gnarks... Ha, I found! Cocktail "Dead pangolin"! Scorpion's poison, some grabber's saliva, and many, many spines of rotten cactus. Gnarks are just loving it. They become unconscious in few minutes, but it is what they love of it.
018_daemon_transition0_1=I need something that is loved by gnarks. The most powerful.
018_daemon_transition1_1=Sounds disgustingly... That's what I need!
018_finish_node0=Oh, our fanatic fighter, again!
018_finish_node1=Are you serious? Can you watch them? You are sanitary guy! Fighters, let's drink to the hero!
018_finish_transition0_1=Folks, I have got a real "Dead pangolin"! Drink to my health and I'll protect you from Willy. I'll watch the chests.
018_finish_transition1_1=Enjoy yourself as much as you need!
018_start_node0=Hey guys! It's that freak from the arena! It was a good battle! You are really mad, you've finished this beast alone!
018_start_node1=We would be happy to do it, but how? We are on duty and have nothing to drink.
018_start_node2=Bloody Willy sent us to watch these fucking chests. Whole day in the sun, we stay like cursed.
018_start_transition0_1=Thank you! That was wow! What do you do here?
018_start_transition1_1=Wait here, I'll think of something.
018_start_transition2_1=I celebrate the victory. Will you join me?
019_finish_node0=Ha-ha, you brought the Devil! I hope you have burned his farm entirely to make that farmer silent? "I must feed my children, I must till the fields..." Ugh!
019_finish_node1=Join the band? Ha-ha, if you will stay alive!
019_finish_transition0_1=I solved the problem with farmer. Bloody Willy, I completed your task, can I join the band now?
019_finish_transition1_1=What are you talking about?
019_start_node0=[A large gnark with many battle scars is staying at the main square in the city surrounded by his followers. It seems it is not that Willy who I need] I am Bloody Willy! And it is my city! What do you need?
019_start_node1=Ha-ha, that small old man? In prison, where else! Waiting for the execution. As everybody who dares to not obey me, Bloody Willy! Hey Gromakh! [Bloody Willy catches one of his mates by the throat] Where is my Black Devil, for which I sent you? Still by the farmer? I am disappointed! Execute him! [Two strong bullboys catch scared Gromakh and take him somewhere into a gateway]
019_start_transition0_1=Where is the sheriff Willy?
019_start_transition1_1=[It's my chance to wriggle into favor...] I'll bring to you this Black Devil, Bloody Willy!
020_daemon_node0=The most honorary member of my guild! You honored me again by your visit!
020_daemon_node1=Whatever you need, my friend! Especially since the grabber chewed all my seeds, so, probably, I will be not able to sell them... Take them for free, my friend!
020_daemon_node2=Ha, I've got everything! You are saying about crazy wheat. Amazing plant! It grows without feeding, everywhere and anytime - including frozen rocks! What is more important - it grows fast! When it's grew up, it is collecting itself and rolling to the mill... What a crazy performance! You must even not try to stay on its way. This thing is too aggressive as for a plant.
020_daemon_transition0_1=I need the seeds for which it is not required to till the field. Do you have such seeds?
020_daemon_transition1_1=Chewed? That explains why they smell so... Thank you!
020_daemon_transition2_1=That's what I need! How much?
020_finish_node0=What a disgusting smell?
020_finish_node1=Exiting! Now, I don't need my Blacky... You can take it. But watch out - don't make it angry - it's wild and almost invulnerable - regenerates like your lizard! The only thing it can't take is a fire. Remember - no fire!
020_finish_transition0_1=Don't pay attention to it, it's just a misunderstanding. It is crazy wheat. You have not to till, collect, and pour water - it will do all itself!
020_finish_transition1_1=No fire. Got it!
020_start_node0=[The old farmer is lazy chewing a little straw braced on the tilted enclosure]
020_start_node1=Do you mean Blacky? Oh, Willy... Dirty bandit. It seems I have no choice, he will burn the farm if I rejected his proposition. But how I'll till the field without Blacky? How to transport the water? All my work will stop then.
020_start_transition0_1=Are you the master of Black Devil? Bloody Willy wants to have it.
020_start_transition1_1=I'll try to think about it.
021_finish_node0=What a battle! You are real freak! Everybody knows that nobody can defeat the Black Devil, but you could! Real cutthroat!
021_finish_node1=Of course! Now you're one of us! Now, you can feel free in the city, nobody will touch you. When we will go on the robbery, you will go with us!
021_finish_transition0_1=May I join your band, Bloody Willy?
021_finish_transition1_1=Wonderful future...
021_start_node0=You brought the Black Devil, so, you will test it. Yard Devil to the arena! Now we will see a beautiful show!
021_start_node1=Well, what you thought? That Bloody Willy will till the fields with Devil? Start the battle!
021_start_transition0_1=What? Fight... with that?
021_start_transition1_1=[Prepare to fight]
022_start_node0=Thanks for rescuing me! These half-blind idiots cannot distinguish a honorary trader and iron toerags! Wait a minute... Are you a hu-man, right? I know this word, because it's how you was called by one my friend, Sheriff Willy. He's very much like you: no horns, no tail, and you're even not blue...
022_start_node1=The old Willy is always moving. Last time when I heard about him, he went to one city to set the rights there. You will find him there.
022_start_transition0_1=Another human? He could know the way from here... Where I can find him?
022_start_transition1_1=Thank you, I will find the Sheriff Willy!
023_finish_node0=You're back! The gnarks didn't understand anything?
023_finish_node1=I'll never forget what you have done for me, friend!
023_finish_transition0_1=All is fine! All gnarks are celebrating, and it's obviously for long time.
023_finish_transition1_1=Not at all. I have many question to you.
023_start_node0=Ps-s-t! Boy! You must take me out of here! Get the key from the prison. It must be among other things in the warehouse of those bastards. It is at the end of the street. You will not miss it, it's guarding 24h...
023_start_node1=The key is not to begin a fight. Because, in this case, many innocents can be hurt. Think of something. Gnarks are not so smart, but like to drink and have a fun...
023_start_transition0_1=How would I get the key if it's by guards?
023_start_transition1_1=I’ll think of something.

028_start_node0=Psst! You there! What are you doing in this town?
028_start_node1=Yes! I came here on a dangerous mission, and it only got more dangerous the longer I was at it. I tell you, friend, DO NOT try to create life out of dust! It ain't worth it!
028_start_node2=No! That's the problem. These golems are all my creations. And as long as I'm alive and around them, they are too powerful. I suppose I'm just here until my battery runs out and I die.
028_start_node3=An excellent idea! Let's see. Golems are all about their ranks, so you're going to have to prove yourself to them, and become the number-one ranked guard in order to get access to me. Gosh, that seems like a lot of work.
028_start_transition0_1=Hey, you're not a golem. Are you from the crew of pirates?
028_start_transition1_1=Noted. I'll get my kicks elsewhere. Can I set you free?
028_start_transition2_1=Hmm! Die...? That gives me an idea. If I can sneak in there, we could take out your battery -- only for a moment of course -- and that will weaken them enough for us to escape!
028_start_transition3_1=Nah, I'm on it.
028_guard_node0=Hmm. What do you do here, human? We new-life golems not like you old-life humans. I guard creator. He is important. I am number one guard. Hmm.
028_guard_node1=Hmm. I am guard. I am not guard manager. Guard manager is in other building. I guard creator. Guard manager manage guards. Very easy to remember.
028_guard_transition0_1=Okay. That sounds like a great job. Do you know who I talk with about doing that myself?
028_guard_transition1_1=Thanks, I'll have a chat with him!
028_guard_finish_node0=What do you want from the smartest guard Higuard?
028_guard_finish_node1=Hmm... Yes... But the smartest guard is Higuard.
028_guard_finish_transition0_1=Look! (show the guard certificate). I’m a guard, too. I’ll guard the prisoner.
028_guard_finish_transition1_1=Yes, of course. But go be smart somewhere else, okay?
028_door_node0=Hey! Meat-man! Get away from that door!
028_door_transition0_1=OK! Yikes!
028_finish_node0=Okay, now we have to remove my battery. You were right, this plan will make the Golem's weak, and they won't be able to stop us.
028_finish_node1=[Ben "dies" in your arms]
028_finish_transition0_1=Okay. You ready? [remove battery]
028_finish_transition1_1=Okay, let's get out of here.
030_finish_node0=Fine! I heard gnarks were talking about your fight. Now they trust you!
030_finish_node1=And now it's time to release me!
030_finish_transition0_1=That was easy.
030_finish_transition1_1=What should I do?
030_start_node0=Hey friend! Can you help?
030_start_node1=You’ll find him in the town center. He calls himself a Bloody Willy. The wretch scared the entire neighborhood.
030_start_node2=My name is Willy! I used to be a sheriff here. Alas, a gnarks’ gang captured it and rules the town on my behalf.
030_start_node3=First, you must gain the leader’s trust. And I’ll try to find out where the key from my cage is.
030_start_transition0_1=Who are you?
030_start_transition1_1=Good! Wait here and don’t go anywhere.
030_start_transition2_1=I was sent to help you. What can I do?
030_start_transition3_1=Where can I find the leader?
032_start_node0=Hmmm. Who are you? What do you need from Manager 001, the most influential, important, wise, patient, and humble resident of the city?
032_start_node1=Are you serious? Uh... great! There are never too many guards. But let me see... I must check your skills first. I can’t hire just anyone who walks through this door.
032_start_node2=Hmm. Spiders. We hate spiders. Deal with the parasites in the neighboring building. Wait! You’ll need a warehouse key. Here it is.
032_start_transition0_1=I want to be a security guard. I hear it's a great job.
032_start_transition1_1=Okay, that sounds fine. What do I need to do?
032_start_transition2_1=Thanks! Don't worry, I'll be the best guard ever!
032_finish_node0=Hmm. Thank you! Great job! Here is your security guard certificate. Do a good job, please.

062_finish_node1=[Behind the door, someone swears, quietly but sincerely. Obviously, the boots were the most valuable thing that har] Huh... OK, business is business. Take your boots.
062_finish_transition0_1=[What a lavish offer...] I want your rubber boots!
062_finish_transition1_1=Thanks! Have a nice time, fisherman!
062_start_node0=[Judging by the fish smell and plenty of worms around the house, a fisherman certainly lives here]
062_start_node1=[From behind the door is going up a quarrelsome voice] Fisher? Once I WAS a fisher, sure! But how can I fish here when that beast came in with its anchor! And caught all the fish so there are none left for me. And it doesn't even eat the fish... It just LIKES THE PROCESS! And now it starts hunting me because I smell like a fish!
062_start_transition0_1=[Knock] Is there a fisherman who lives here? I need to borrow your rubber boots.
062_start_transition1_1=Okay, okay, I'll take care on the monster and come back, does that sound good?
068_finish_node0=Thanks Great God! You've got skins! We have one more day to live!
068_finish_transition0_1=Tell me about your God.
068_start_node0=Stop! Why do you make all that noise? The God doesn't like when someone's making noise! Oh, no!! We all are dead now! Bring the skins to the God, quickly! He gets quiet with skins!
068_start_node1=Ours! He is arisen here. Powerful! Scary! Eating as much as a dozen of us! If we don't give the skins to him, we are dead! Please, save us, bring the skins to the God!
068_start_transition0_1=Which God?

126_start_node0=Hey, are you that brave guy that just helps everybody? Gromov, right?
126_start_node1=What a stroke of luck that I met you... The fact is, I am a scientist-arachnologist. You know, we study spiders. And my problem is that the more I know about spiders... The more scared I become! I have nightmares! I imagine how they catch me, wrap in web, and then... Oh my God, I am going to faint right now.
126_start_node2=This is not a problem! I learned how to hide it because I'm ashamed of it! But the paper work is one thing, and real expedition - quite another! They went on an expedition, Gromov! And asked me to go with them, because they need an assistant!
126_start_node3=Exactly! My colleagues are trying to save from extinction one very rare species - Funestae Mortis. And they need one more participant on their expedition to collect the data and guard the spiders. Will you help me?
126_start_node4=I'll pay you! I will give you everything I have! Anything's better than getting closer to those giant things, with their snapping jaws, rolling eyes... Oh God, I feel queasy.
126_start_transition0_1=Ouch, everybody will recognize me on the street. I am Gromov. What can I do for you?
126_start_transition0_2=No, you are wrong! This is absolutely not me! [turn around and run away screaming]
126_start_transition1_1=Maybe you should think about a new job?
126_start_transition1_2=It sounds like a real problem.
126_start_transition2_1=I think I know what you mean. Do you want me to go with them instead of you?
126_start_transition2_2=Sorry, pal. I have no time for it.
126_start_transition3_1=Of course. Show me where this section of spider friends is getting together.
126_start_transition3_2=I hate spiders. So, the reward better be great.
126_start_transition3_3=Maybe next time. See you later!
126_start_transition4_1=Don't worry, boy. I'll take it!
126_start_transition4_2=Hmmm... I'll try to come later, OK? And you come down.
126_rescued_fox_node0=You saved us! We were going to be breakfast, lunch, and dinner for those monsters!
126_rescued_fox_node1=Extinction? Heck, no! We were mistaken! These monsters are not under a treat of extinction, we are! You must kill them! All of them! And also destroy their nests!
126_rescued_fox_node2=We were in there for two days, just waiting for death! This Funestae Mortis -- it's one of the deadliest spiders in all the shards!
126_rescued_fox_transition0_1=You are those arachnologists who must save this species from extinction, right?
126_rescued_fox_transition1_1=You are a very suspicious-looking arachnologist. It seems that spider's cocoons are changing the people very well.
126_rescued_fox_transition1_2=Go ahead, destroy everything here!
126_rescued_fox_transition2_1=Well done, gentlemen. Let's help the evolution a bit!
126_finish_node0=You're back! How was the expedition? All is OK? Did you save the spiders?
126_finish_node1=Take your reward! And thank you for help!
126_finish_node2=Oh my God. It's all just like in my nightmares. Help me, I feel like there's no air! And my eyes -- stinging -- blinding me... [with a quiet groan, the scientist faints. He drops a small bag with coins. It seems to be my reward]
126_finish_transition0_1=Mmm… sure. Rescued, you bet!
126_finish_transition0_2=Oh, the expedition went fine. The spiders attacked all of your friends, made cocoons around them and sat there, waiting for the gastric juice to dissolve…
126_finish_transition1_1=Thanks. Really, give switching careers a thought.
126_finish_transition2_1=Looks like I went too far. Hope he'll be OK.
127_start_node0=[You see a frightened fox in rags. Looks like he got the treatment… He stares in space and mumbles something quietly.]
127_start_node1=Gold… They wanted gold… I could swear they snarled 'Gold'...
127_start_node2=My caravan was passing the snow lands, when stone panthers came out of nowhere. They destroyed our wagons in a blink of an eye, with that strange roar, 'Grrrhold, grrrrhold'… I am the only survivor. Nothing left. Even my family jewel, the Priceless Diamond, is gone ... [starts weeping uncontrollably]
127_start_transition0_1=Hey, are you okay?
127_start_transition0_2=[Ignore the poor thing]
127_start_transition1_1=Who snarled? Give me more detail.
127_start_transition1_2=[Leave the madman alone]
127_start_transition2_1=Calm down, bud. Show me, where the attack took place, and I'll try to deal with those talking panthers.
127_start_transition2_2=Sorry, buddy. Don't think I could help here.
127_the_troll_node0=You why do this? You why good creatures beat up? You monster, bad!
127_the_troll_node1=You liar! Creatures nice, creatures find treasure for Drobgo. No hurt anyone!
127_the_troll_node2=Drobgo see. Drobgo ashamed. Drobgo show creatures gold, tell about gold, tell to mine it. Creatures not good. Very evil. Drobgo so sorry. Take gold, give back.
127_the_troll_transition0_1=Nice creatures? They rob caravans and kill merchants!
127_the_troll_transition0_2=You are the monster! And you'll pay for this.
127_the_troll_transition1_1=Look around, Drobgo! It's the cemetery! Your beasts don't search for treasure, they are taking it from the travelers!
127_the_troll_transition1_2=Are you kidding me?! I'll show you… troll!
127_the_troll_transition2_1=Thanks, Drobgo. Be careful with animals next time. In fact, train something smaller. Like rabbits, or dodos.
127_finish_node0=Did you find my caravan?
127_finish_node1=Thank you so much, hero, thank you! I will never forget this!
127_finish_transition0_1=It's fine. Here's your gem, and some gold, too. Get yourself a new caravan. The panthers will bother you no more.
127_finish_transition0_2=I did, but the gold was gone. Found your gem, though.
127_finish_transition1_1=Sure. Take care!
128_start_node0=Young man! Your stride and expression lead me to believe you are an adventurer, maverick and choleric, prone to assisting strangers. Am I right?
128_start_node1=I am a psychologist. My name is Freudus. I am looking for a young, brave assistant. For a decent reward, of course.
128_start_node2=Oh no, no fights. We will study! Study the psychology of our old friends, the barbaric and savage rats. I have prepared a survey. Get their replies to it. It will provide us with tons of information! You know, I believe rats are not that bad. Undisciplined, maybe. But very kind on the inside!
128_start_node3=Oh, you are flattering me, young man. I am merely a genius. And we will study! Study the psychology of our old friends, the barbaric and savage rats. I have prepared a survey. Get their replies to it. It will provide us with tons of information! You know, I believe rats are not that bad. Undisciplined, maybe. But very kind on the inside!
128_start_node4=Since rats are greedy - that's for sure, - here's some money to heat up their interest. Offer them pay, and they will be happy to cooperate.
128_start_transition0_1=Let me try, too: I see you like addressing strangers with weird questions.
128_start_transition0_2=Exactly! Are you a wizard?
128_start_transition0_3=Helping strangers? I hate it! [run away]
128_start_transition1_1=I'm in, doc. Where to go, who to fight?
128_start_transition1_2=Wow! Always wanted to become a wizard's assistant.
128_start_transition1_3=Maybe, some other time. See you!
128_start_transition2_1=Somewhere very, very deep inside, maybe… Give me your survey.
128_start_transition2_2=That's an interesting theory. We should check it.
128_start_transition2_3=Bad idea, doc. I pass.
128_start_transition3_1=Somewhere very, very deep inside, maybe… Give me your survey.
128_start_transition3_2=That's an interesting theory. We should check it.
128_start_transition3_3=Bad idea, doc. I pass.
128_start_transition4_1=Sounds like a plan. Be back soon with a report!
128_retkin_psicho_node0=Hold it, stranger! I, Scrills, am in charge here! Me and my guys! Go away!
128_retkin_psicho_node1=Two hundred sounds good. What do you want? Speak, fast.
128_retkin_psicho_node2=Is he dressed nice? Any profit out of him?
128_retkin_psicho_node3=Huh, Scrulls, so it's your trap he got into! And we were making fun of you… The trap works, who would've thought! Go finish him before he gets out!
128_retkin_psicho_node4=[Scrills' eyes widen] Scralls! You big fat jerk! That was Mom's cup! I'm gonna gut you like a fish!
128_retkin_psicho_node5=[Scrills calms down a bit, but is still looking at Scralls with suspicion] Okay, if he didn't touch it, that's fine. Any more questions? I'm getting tired, give me the money!
128_retkin_psicho_node6=Get him, guys! He's got one grand! Let's take it!
128_retkin_psicho_transition0_1=There's a way to get two hundred. Are you in?
128_retkin_psicho_transition0_2=The test is over before it started. [leave]
128_retkin_psicho_transition1_1=It's easy. I ask you a question, you answer it. Fast, without thinking. The first one is, 'You see a traveler…'
128_retkin_psicho_transition2_1=It doesn't say. Let me finish. So, you see a traveler that fell into a trap. What will you do?
128_retkin_psicho_transition2_2=I see [pay and leave]
128_retkin_psicho_transition3_1=Hmmm. Guess, the response is clear. Second question, 'Your friend broke your favorite cup by accident.'
128_retkin_psicho_transition3_2=I see. [pay and leave]
128_retkin_psicho_transition4_1=Wait! It's a hypothetical question. He didn't actually break your cup.
128_retkin_psicho_transition4_2=I see. [pay and leave]
128_retkin_psicho_transition5_1=The last one. 'Suppose, I have a thousand coins…'
128_retkin_psicho_transition5_2=This is getting dangerous! [pay and leave]
128_retkin_psicho_transition6_1=It was hypothetical, too! Blast! [defend yourself]
128_finish_node0=You are back! How did our lab rats do on the test?
128_finish_node1=But of course, colleague! Here is your reward, those are great news! I can't wait to meet our new friends!
128_finish_node2=What a pity. Well, a negative result is a result, too. At least, we've acquired new data on rats.
128_finish_node3=I agree, my friend. Don't know where to start yet, but I will come up with something. Thank you for your assistance!
128_finish_transition0_1=They have demonstrated their intelligence and discretion. I highly recommend that you meet them in person.
128_finish_transition0_2=Horrible. They are nothing but rude, cruel and malicious beasts, Kinesthetics, too. To the extreme.
128_finish_transition0_3=Bad, but not hopeless. Deep inside, they are not that horrible.
128_finish_transition1_1=Just kidding. These beasts are rude and cruel. Stay home, doc.
128_finish_transition1_2=I believe you should go there at once, sir! [shame on you, Gromov!]
128_finish_transition2_1=I wouldn't call that new, doc. Let's just accept the fact that rats are hopeless.
128_finish_transition3_1=Just kidding. There is no hope of improvement, they are hardened criminals.
128_finish_transition3_2=Going to rehabilitate the rats? Good luck, you'll need it.
129_start_node0=[A giant Forger warrior is all alone and sad. He's making strange noises that seem to be sighs]
129_start_node1=Nothing is fine! Hate it! Hate it!
129_start_node2=NATURE! Can't stand it. I had the best friends ever! We forged tons of metal together, cut down thousands of trees, poured endless amounts of oil into the rivers! And now they've gone mad: keep staring at those trees and telling me how much they worship that dang nature!
129_start_node3=And suspicious! Look, can you talk to them? What if this could be reversed? They are the talk of the town already. That they have become those… you know. The nature lovers.
129_start_node4=It has been different! I remember, how we used to say, 'Blech! How disgusting nature is.' And they'll be like, 'Yeah, really yucky, let's go cut more trees!' And it's-- it's changed so much now! [the warrior's rough voice starts to quiver]
129_start_transition0_1=Are you OK?
129_start_transition0_2=[Leave him be]
129_start_transition1_1=Wow! Calm down, bud. What do you hate?
129_start_transition1_2=ME TOO! What is it, that we hate, anyhow?
129_start_transition2_1=Wow. That's weird.
129_start_transition2_2=I like nature, too. What's wrong with it?
129_start_transition3_1=I'll try.
129_start_transition3_2=What if they simply got smarter at last?
129_start_transition3_3=Some other time, maybe.
129_start_transition4_1=Okay, I'll see what's wrong with them.
129_start_transition4_2=Sorry, can't help you there.
129_smith_friends_node0=Greetings, traveler! Have you noticed, how pretty the grass is today? How breathtaking the trees are?
129_smith_friends_node1=Look closer! It's a… real wonder!
129_smith_friends_node2=You understand us! Not like our kin. They hardly notice this beauty… And keep destroying it mindlessly. You should go to the Lake of Truth, friend. It's not far away from here. Get some rest, enjoy the scenery, drink some of its clear water. It's an amazing place!
129_smith_friends_node3=Sad to know this. But you can become better, too! You should go to the Lake of Truth, friend. It's not far away from here. Get some rest, enjoy the scenery, drink some of its clear water. It's an amazing place!
129_smith_friends_transition0_1=Err… nope?
129_smith_friends_transition0_2=I agree, very beautiful.
129_smith_friends_transition0_3=Really? Rather ugly trees, to my taste. And so is the grass, too.
129_smith_friends_transition1_1=I see now. Amazing!
129_smith_friends_transition1_2=Still see nothing. Stupid nature.
129_smith_friends_transition2_1=Lake of Truth? Sounds strange, I'd better check this out.
129_smith_friends_transition3_1=Lake of Truth? Sounds strange, I'd better check this out.
129_fox_shaman_node0=[An old fox, humming a song, pours one vial after another into the lake] What? Who are you? I'm just strolling by.
129_fox_shaman_node1=Nothing! Just… enjoying the outside. Trees, grass..
129_fox_shaman_node2=Okay, fine, I admit it. I'm adding the nature appreciation potion to the lake waters. I invented it myself, by the way! So that these Forgers will finally stop cutting down our trees, and realize nature is wonderful.
129_fox_shaman_node3=Unfortunately, the potion is only effective for a couple of days. Been here for a month now. And they did stop cutting! And the lake is pure now.
129_fox_shaman_node4=Thanks for your support, friend! We'll keep this our little secret, right?
129_fox_shaman_node5=How dare you… Fine. Here, that's all I have. Extortionist!
129_fox_shaman_node6=I know it's not a right thing to do. But please, think before you tell on me. These rude, cruel and greedy Forgers are destroying our world! If they will have their way… I'm afraid to even think of it. I can't protect all the shards, but at least my magic can save my part of the world.
129_fox_shaman_transition0_1=And I think you are pouring tons of potion into the lake.
129_fox_shaman_transition0_2=What are you doing here?
129_fox_shaman_transition1_1=Another nature lover, huh? Tell me, what did you do to these Forgers?
129_fox_shaman_transition2_1=This is wrong!
129_fox_shaman_transition2_2=Great idea!
129_fox_shaman_transition2_3=Will they stay like that forever?
129_fox_shaman_transition3_1=This is wrong!
129_fox_shaman_transition3_2=Great idea! Keep it up!
129_fox_shaman_transition4_1=Sure!
129_fox_shaman_transition4_2=Sure! Provided you pay me…
129_fox_shaman_transition4_3=Sorry, can't promise anything.
129_fox_shaman_transition5_1=That's better!
129_fox_shaman_transition6_1=[Leave]
129_finish_node0=So? How are my friends doing? Did you find out anything?
129_finish_node1=Drink? No… what sort of a question is this?
129_finish_node2=Sounds silly… But I have nothing better to do, anyhow. I'll try your strange advice, little human.
129_finish_node3=So, I will be alone forever? Hate nature! Hate it!
129_finish_node4=A shaman? I'll knock his teeth out! I'm here to rescue you, my friends!
129_finish_transition0_1=Looks like they just changed. Deal with it.
129_finish_transition0_2=Would you like a drink, by any chance?
129_finish_transition0_3=An old shaman put a spell on your friends. They'll be back to normal, once they stop drinking from the lake.
129_finish_transition1_1=Go to the lake next to your friends. Drink some water. And you will be their friend again.
129_finish_transition1_2=Never mind. Your friends changed, that's all.
129_finish_transition1_3=Well, your friends did, and drank water enchanted by an old shaman. Drive him out, and everything will be back to normal.
129_finish_transition2_1=Good luck!
129_finish_transition3_1=Right!
129_finish_transition4_1=[Leave]
130_start_node0=Wait! You're that little guy with the machines, right?
130_start_node1=Come on, I knew it was you straight away! I've been looking for you.
130_start_node2=My brother, Bestiarnold… Lost it completely! Got himself a pet!
130_start_node3=You don't get it! He tamed a swamp stomper! They are wild and blood-thirsty! And uncontrollable! And he says we're just envious and talk bad about Stompy… Stompy! Anyhow, my brother was banished from the village, with that… Trampie of his!
130_start_node4=Could you talk to him? What if he needs help? What if he wants to come back? Or, maybe, his Stompy's already dead, pox on him?
130_start_transition0_1=Gromov. How may I help you?
130_start_transition0_2=No, I'm not him.
130_start_transition1_1=Let me guess. You have a problem. What happened?
130_start_transition1_2=Sorry, some other time.
130_start_transition2_1=And how is that bad, exactly?
130_start_transition3_1=What can I do?
130_start_transition4_1=Okay, I'll see how he is doing.
130_start_transition4_2=Sorry, some other time.
130_scampish_brother_1_node0=[A huge Forger is looking tenderly at a small and quite disgusting stomper]
130_scampish_brother_1_node1=I am Bestiarnold. And if you're here to hurt my baby, I'll…
130_scampish_brother_1_node2=Really? Me too! Everyone says they're disgusting, but look at this gracefulness! And those pretty eyes! And this sweet voice... [the stomper makes a chainsaw noise]
130_scampish_brother_1_node3=Are you insane? Look at him! Isn't he precious? [the stomper screams as if being torn apart]
130_scampish_brother_1_node4=If you are not into stompers, why did you come here? [the stomper snarls, making you want to kick it really hard]
130_scampish_brother_1_node5=I'm doing great! The only thing is… Stompy isn't used to the new place yet. So I'm afraid he'll take off if I leave him alone. And he's just a baby. Help me find food for him. He just loves poisonous mushrooms!
130_scampish_brother_1_transition0_1=Bestiarnold, right? And this must be Stompy?
130_scampish_brother_1_transition1_1=I'm not going to hurt anyone!
130_scampish_brother_1_transition1_2=Hurt that beauty? I adore stompers!
130_scampish_brother_1_transition1_3=Look, this is a swamp monster, and an ugly one. Why even bother wasting time on it?
130_scampish_brother_1_transition2_1=Charming. Actually, your brother sent me to see if you're doing okay. Are you?
130_scampish_brother_1_transition3_1=Cute, indeed. I like stompers.
130_scampish_brother_1_transition3_2=Sorry, but I really don't get your infatuation with it.
130_scampish_brother_1_transition4_1=Your brother sent me to see if you're doing okay. Are you?
130_scampish_brother_1_transition5_1=Poisonous mushrooms for the stomper. Okay.
130_scampish_brother_2_node0=Got mushrooms? Stompy is starving!
130_scampish_brother_2_node1=[The stomper starts devouring the mushrooms with a loud noise] There you go, sweetie! Eat and grow! Look, could you do me another favor? Stompy has trouble sleeping lately, could you get some spider venom for him? It's like their sleeping aid.
130_scampish_brother_2_transition0_1=There you go! As poisonous as it gets!
130_scampish_brother_2_transition0_2=Sorry, not this time.
130_scampish_brother_2_transition1_1=Spider venom. Great.
130_scampish_brother_2_transition1_2=Sure, anything for Stompy!
130_scampish_brother_3_node0=Got venom?
130_scampish_brother_3_node1=Cool, huh? He's getting big!
130_scampish_brother_3_node2=Of course it's safe! Trampie is absolutely harmless, what are you talking about?
130_scampish_brother_3_node3=Thank you, he'll sleep tight now… Oh, there is this one last thing I want you to do. Ask my brother for a loan. Just a bit, 500 coins will do. Stompy loves chewing on them! [The stomper growls ferociously. Or purrs, maybe...]
130_scampish_brother_3_transition0_1=Here's your venom. Nightie night, Stompy.
130_scampish_brother_3_transition0_2=Stompy… grew up?
130_scampish_brother_3_transition0_3=Still looking!
130_scampish_brother_3_transition1_1=Are you sure it's safe to keep a trampler?
130_scampish_brother_3_transition1_2=I got venom.
130_scampish_brother_3_transition2_1=Hope so. Here's your venom.
130_scampish_brother_3_transition3_1=Chewing on coins… Why do I keep helping you?
130_disquieted_smith_node0=Did you find my brother? Is he okay?
130_disquieted_smith_node1=A thousand coins? Wow! Well, he's my brother, after all… Here you go.
130_disquieted_smith_node2=Five hundred? What is he, into gambling now? Oh, well, here. Hope it helps.
130_disquieted_smith_transition0_1=They are both doing fine. And your brother asked for 500 coins.
130_disquieted_smith_transition0_2=Your brother asked for 1000 coins and said it was urgent. Didn't explain why.
130_disquieted_smith_transition1_1=You are a good brother! You're always helping me out.
130_disquieted_smith_transition2_1=Hope so.
130_finish_node0=What? What happened to Bestiarnold? Tell me!
130_finish_node1=Oh, no, woe is on me! Why, why didn't I talk him out of this madness?!
130_finish_node2=Oh, what is he spending it on, in the middle of a swamp? Okay, okay, here's another 500, but no more, tell him this.
130_finish_node3=[The Forger starts weeping. It's best to leave him alone]
130_finish_transition0_1=Stompy grew up and ate your brother.
130_finish_transition0_2=Don't even know how to tell you… Bestiarnold has left this world…
130_finish_transition0_3=Oh, everything is great. He asks for another 500.
130_finish_transition1_1=It's not your fault. There was nothing you could do.
130_finish_transition1_2=I'm so sorry for your loss.
130_finish_transition1_3=You should've tried harder.
130_finish_transition2_1=Of course!
130_finish_transition3_1=[Leave]
131_start_node0=Gromov! My dear friend Gromov!
131_start_node1=Nice to meet you. I'm Malifarchi, forger, trader and a good guy. Heard a lot about you.
131_start_node2=You are smart, Gromov, right? Here's the thing. I've heard you've worked with adamantium. I'm really curious about it, we haven't even seen it here. But now I just heard about this dungeon. Full of adamantium, they say! So, I want you to clear out the monsters living there.
131_start_node3=Come back later, then. And remember: we could get rich!
131_start_node4=Awesome! I knew you'd recognize a good deal straight away! [Malifarchi starts shaking your hand, smiling vigorously]
131_start_node5=You are a businessman, right? Two grand, gold. Deal?
131_start_node6=Oh, you're a shark! Okay, Gromov. Three grand!
131_start_node7=Five grand?! Come on, for that money, I could hire a whole army with an orchestra! Three grand is my last offer, Gromov.
131_start_transition0_1=Do I know you?
131_start_transition1_1=Hi, Malifarchi.
131_start_transition1_2=What do you want?
131_start_transition2_1=A whole dungeon? That will cost you.
131_start_transition2_2=Okay.
131_start_transition2_3=Sorry, I'm busy right now.
131_start_transition3_1=[Leave]
131_start_transition4_1=[Leave]
131_start_transition5_1=Deal!
131_start_transition5_2=Three grand!
131_start_transition5_3=Whole dungeon, Malifarchi. Five grand!
131_start_transition6_1=Deal!
131_start_transition7_1=Deal!
131_finish_node0=You are back! How is the dungeon doing?
131_finish_node1=YEAAAAH!!! The only adamantium supplier for the Forgers! I'll be rich! Filthy rich!
131_finish_node2=Sure! But that's the only one recommended by Gromov himself! Look!! [Malifarchi shows a poster with you two shaking hands, and a signature, 'I confirm, the best adamantium ever. Gromov.']
131_finish_transition0_1=All clear, Malifarchi.
131_finish_transition1_1=You do know there are other adamantium mines on the shards, right?
131_finish_transition1_2=Hm. Good luck. Weirdo.
131_finish_transition2_1=How did you do this? Ah, whatever. I'm impressed, Malifarchi.
131_finish_transition2_2=Oh you shrewd…
132_start_node0=My analysis show you're not one of us. Just what I need.
132_start_node1=Sorry, I'm just very excited to meet someone who is not one of the Created. Can you keep a secret?
132_start_node2=[The robot presses a button, and his voice becomes much lower] Those are dangerous things I can't discuss with any of the Created. My old friend and colleague.. He is... A HERETIC!
132_start_node3=Us, scientists, go easy on this, but for the rest of the Created, nothing is worse than doubting the wisdom of the Creator. Save even thinking of becoming one. And my colleague, TR8T0R, broke the taboo!
132_start_node4=We are all forbidden to even talk of him, save seeing him. But I'm afraid his experiments will go too far. The last time we talked, he said he wants to follow the Creator's path! And… create life! This is extremely dangerous, and could change the whole world. Please, find out about his progress and let me know.
132_start_transition0_1=I'm not a robot, if that's what you mean.
132_start_transition0_2=One of you?
132_start_transition1_1=Sure.
132_start_transition1_2=Secret Keeper's my middle name!
132_start_transition2_1=[Try to mimic reverential awe]
132_start_transition2_2=Is that… bad?
132_start_transition3_1=Wow. And what do you want of me?
132_start_transition4_1=Okay.
132_start_transition4_2=Some other time, maybe.
132_robot_heretic_1_node0=[The robot is mumbling something digging through a pile of scrap metal]
132_robot_heretic_1_node1=Friend? [The robot presses a button; now his voice is full of contempt]. Which one? One of those that banished me? One of those causing me to work here, in dirt and dust, without even basic equipment, such as magnet spectrometers?
132_robot_heretic_1_node2=All of the Created are pathetic idiots. I was like them, too. Believing that the Creator is an divine, wise being, while being made out of metal and microchips! How stupid! Anyone can make thousands of us with enough materials, time and intelligence. So, the Great Infallible Creator is a lie! Whoever created us, was intelligent, but not divine! And I'll prove it by creating life myself!
132_robot_heretic_1_node3=Not just a robot. A thinking, intelligent being! Free and beautiful! And you will help me. I need some parts to complete my work. You can get them from the malicious metal monsters swarming in the vicinity. I'll give you the list. You will be part of a great experiment!
132_robot_heretic_1_node4=Dangerous? Sure! But will that stop a true scientist? Especially when the success of the experiment means the end of the silly religion that hundreds of metal idiots are following? I can't let this chance go.
132_robot_heretic_1_transition0_1=You are TR8T0R, right? Your friend sent me.
132_robot_heretic_1_transition1_1=That friend, yes.
132_robot_heretic_1_transition1_2=Maybe some other friend. I can't remember.
132_robot_heretic_1_transition2_1=Are you going to assemble a robot?
132_robot_heretic_1_transition3_1=Don't you think this could be dangerous?
132_robot_heretic_1_transition3_2=Okay, I'll get the parts.
132_robot_heretic_1_transition4_1=Okay, I'll get the parts.
132_robot_heretic_2_node0=Did you get all the parts?
132_robot_heretic_2_node1=Great! Step aside now, it won't take long... [The robot starts running around, gathering some scraps, parts and, it seems, other robots' detached ligaments].
132_robot_heretic_2_node2=Weld here, and… it's alive! IT'S ALIVE! ALIVE!! [The robot starts jumping in ecstasy around some weird, rusty and ugly contraption]
132_robot_heretic_2_transition0_1=Yep, according to the list.
132_robot_heretic_2_transition0_2=Not yet.
132_robot_heretic_2_transition1_1=[Wait]
132_robot_heretic_2_transition2_1=[Talk to the new Created]
132_the_new_robot_node0=[A rusty, ugly robot looks at its creator, rocking back and forth]
132_the_new_robot_node1=Mechanism check: done. Environment check: Creator located. Creator worship on. HAIL CREATOR! Preaching: WORSHIP THE CREATOR, WISE AND INFALLIBLE!
132_the_new_robot_transition0_1=Hey, are you okay?
132_the_new_robot_transition1_1=[Leave]
132_robot_heretic_3_node0=[The robot looks embarrassed]
132_robot_heretic_3_node1=I wanted to create someone free of our superstitions… But now it thinks I'm the creator and worships me! Me, a mere builder! So, maybe this was the same situation as one that made us… I feel sorry for him now.
132_robot_heretic_3_node2=Who knows? Could be the miscalculation. Or a microchip error. Or the wrong code! I don't know. But what I know now is that creating a free-willed intelligent being isn't easy. Perhaps, they simply needed to believe? And for robots that was just impossible?
132_robot_heretic_3_node3=[The robots looks at his creation with care] Next? First, I'll take care of my new friend. I'll name him N3W80RN. Maybe, I will be better at rearing, than creating. And, please, don't mention him to anyone. I don't want anything bad to happen.
132_robot_heretic_3_transition0_1=Congratulations, Creator!
132_robot_heretic_3_transition0_2=Are you happy now?
132_robot_heretic_3_transition1_1=What are you going to do next?
132_robot_heretic_3_transition1_2=Any idea why it went that way?
132_robot_heretic_3_transition2_1=What's next?
132_robot_heretic_3_transition3_1=Good luck!
132_finish_node0=Did you find TR8T0R?
132_finish_node1=Oh, no, we must stop this!
132_finish_node2=I've already sent the horrible news to everyone. We must destroy that creature!
132_finish_transition0_1=He did it! He created an intelligent being!
132_finish_transition0_2=He failed. Forget him and his experiments.
132_finish_transition1_1=I agree. This will end badly.
132_finish_transition1_2=Let's keep it a secret, okay? It will benefit everyone.
132_finish_transition1_3=[Leave]
132_finish_transition2_1=[Leave]
111_start_node3=Stupid monster who live around here. He not gnark why we kick ball around. He think games are boring and want quiet, so he gnark ball. This only ball he NOT take because it beep and be noisy. So we never give it up!
111_start_transition2_2=Wait, who else is stealing your ball?
111_start_transition3_1=Okay, well, let me think about this a little.
111_money_or_fight_transition0_4=I'm still think-- er, gnarking about it.
119_fake_dave_node3=Huh? Oh, Gromov. It's me, Dave. Everything's okay! Save me buddy! Ha ha! Just a little joke, there, kid. You ain't never going to see Dave again, not a chance. You'll die, and he'll live on forever in my memory banks, hating you until the end of the universe.
119_fake_dave_node4=Oh, it is, and I really have you to thank for bringing along all your friends. The battles and death that will be occurring will be like music to my ears. Screams, anger, death: it's like a symphony.
119_fake_dave_transition3_1=No, that can't be!
119_fake_dave_transition4_1=NO!! STOP IT!! [attack]
119_void_final_node0=G-Gromov? What-- what happened?
119_void_final_node1=I'm -- I'm okay. I feel like a great weight has lifted off me. What did you do? Please, buddy, help me up, and let's go home.
119_void_final_node2=Yes, let's go back to your puny Earth, where there is misery and anger everywhere that I can eat. Let's do it.
119_void_final_node3=What do you mean? I'm your friend. I believed in you when no one else would. I'm here. It's me.
119_void_final_node4=You created me. You created everything that fed me. All your stupid actions and all your hubris. You think you can just walk away from that? Now, yes, we are going back. You, and me, and The Void. We are one, and there is nothing that can divide us now. You will be all powerful, now that you have created this. You know I'm just a part of you now. You can't live without me.
119_void_final_node5=You are. You always have been. What could you possibly say now that would make any difference?
119_void_final_node6=Ha! What do I care? Why do you think The Void cares one tiny bit for how you feel about what you've done? Why do you >skkkrrkk< need >krrkr< ave >kkkrrkkrs< ive you? >kkskkskrkkrksk<
119_void_final_node7=>kkskksk< Hi, Gromov.
119_void_final_node8=>skk< Please don't. Please go on with your life. You have a lot of good yet to do that will balance out your mistakes. I forgive you. You're my friend, and I still believe in you. >skkskkkkkcrrkk<
119_void_final_node9=>skkrrkk< NO! What is this idiocy?! Why would you say you forgive him, you stupid simulation of a person? Why would--
119_void_final_transition0_1=Dave? Dave?! Are you all right? Are you in there? There are charges set to blow this place up. We have to get out of here.
119_void_final_transition1_1=Okay, give me your hand. I knew that being uploaded into a computer couldn't change who you are. Come on.
119_void_final_transition1_2=I'm sorry. I can't take you with me.
119_void_final_transition2_1=Wait, what? The Void is still in you -- the Void is still alive?
119_void_final_transition3_1=I can't take you with me. That's what the Void wants. I know that's what you want. Your mind is in there, but Dave, you're... you're it now. It's feeding you all that hate.
119_void_final_transition4_1=I can, and I will. Bye.
119_void_final_transition4_2=I want to talk to Dave.
119_void_final_transition5_1=Dave, I'm... I'm sorry. I remember now. I was foolish. I thought I knew better than everyone else. I thought I could do no wrong. You believed in me when no one else would, and it killed you. I'm sorry. I don't deserve your forgiveness, but I am truly sorry.
119_void_final_transition6_1=Dave?
119_void_final_transition7_1=I'm so sorry. My mistakes got you killed. I wish I could take it all back. I wish I could trade your life for mine.
119_void_final_transition8_1=Bye, Dave.
119_void_final_transition9_1=Because he's the best person I ever met, and because he just freed me from you. Good bye. [detonate charges]
098_start_node2=Ah, I never had no family to speak of, and it's been so long now that they don't miss me none. I suppose that's why you want to get out of here, eh son?
098_start_node3=Well, friend, I ain't budgin' from this spot. If you're lookin' for help, I reckon you can have a little chin-wag with the Created.
098_start_node4=Sure! Mechanical Fellas. Ain't seen 'em in years, not properly. I seen the Pirate types, a'course, but they don't know nothin' about what you need. But they might have the information on their pals. Find them and check 'em out.
098_start_transition2_1=Actually, I... I don't know. I hit my head when I landed and things are just starting to come back little by little. I have to find my friend Dave, first of all, and then we both have to get out of here.
098_start_transition3_1=The Created?
098_start_transition4_1=Okay, thanks.
097_start_node2=Well, we be about to head out to parts unknown, but we be missing our crewmember. He set out when we came to port and said he was going to rustle us up some new shipmates. Understaffed, we were. And yet he never returned. If ye can find him, I can give ye the information ye seek.
097_start_transition2_1=All right, I'll be back.
104_start_node2=What can I do for you, Creator? This is such an honor.
104_start_node3=Oh, well, I am L34D3R. I am the elected representative of the Created here. We Created are not so different from the other mechanical ones in this land, but for this one small difference: our optical sensors have been opened to the truth. The flesh creatures around us were born screaming, their generations after generations stumbling through the gruesome and inefficient samsara of evolution. Not us! Created with a single stroke by a brilliant mind. A mind like yours!
104_start_node4=Sure, Creator, I live to serve.
104_start_node5=We Created have observed and charted the astral bodies in the sky with perfect precision (we are exact, but not creative like you) and have realized that all of these worlds that we move around and through are orbiting a central point in space. Their complex motion in relation to each other means that your radio may not work sometimes, when the distance is too great or massive chunks of land are in the way. Normally I would say it is no crime to rely on technology, but perhaps this is the one exception. Ha ha!
104_start_node6=This central point is called the Citadel. It lies motionless in the silent void as every other shard whirls around it. That is where all answers lie. We can only imagine what kind of wise machines are buried there. A great graveyard of Created, from eons ago!
104_start_node7=I have no doubt that the exit to this system of worlds lies at its center. The Citadel is the force that pulls us all together, that brings Creators like you from the far corners of the universe. It must be where one can return. I know of no one who has gone to the Citadel that has come back to tell of it so I infer that the citadel holds one of two things: either the secret to returning home, or death.
104_start_node8=Let me see that radio for a moment, Creator. I think, if we can line up the times that you've had a good connection with your friend with what we know about the orbits of this shard, we can pinpoint his location. [plugs your radio into his chest] Yes, ah, here we are. It's as I thought. He is on the same shard as the Citadel, motionless at the center.
104_start_node9=That is where our interests coincide, Creator. We Created are working to pinpoint the Citadel ourselves. Our pursuit of knowledge sets us apart from the ordinary mechanical creatures in this world, and we wish to find this place and thereby unlock the secrets of all Creation.
104_start_node10=We have worked long and hard on creating three space probes, which will enter the maelstrom of space around the Citadel and both send back information about it and triangulate its exact location. This would allow us unprecedented accuracy, and potentially allow you to travel there and meet your friend. What do you say? Can you help us launch these three probes? A Creator like you should have no problem.
104_start_transition2_1=You know, well, honestly, it's really great to be here. Everyone seemed super reluctant to show me the way to get to you until I did every last one of their little chores. So what's your name? And what are the Created?
104_start_transition3_1=Man, I could learn to get used to all the positive vibes around here. Thanks, L34D3R. I understand that you Created are devoted to studying, and that you know some secrets about this world. Can I ask you some questions?
104_start_transition4_1=What is the nature of this world?
104_start_transition4_2=How do I get back home?
104_start_transition4_3=How can I find my friend Dave that I talk to on this radio?
104_start_transition5_1=[listen politely]
104_start_transition6_1=Wow. That's amazing that you've figured all that out. Can I ask you another question?
104_start_transition6_2=Pretty interesting. I think that's all the questions I need to ask.
104_start_transition7_1=Heavy stuff. How can I get there?
104_start_transition7_2=Whew! Can I ask you another question?
104_start_transition7_3=I think that's all the questions I have.
104_start_transition8_1=Whoa. So how can I get to him?
104_start_transition9_1=What would you like me to do? For once, I'm excited to help!
104_start_transition10_1=You bet. Just point the way!
104_start_transition10_2=Sounds interesting. Maybe later. I have a few things I need to accomplish first.
106_start_node2=Oh, one other thing. T1NK3R3R is a little strange. He doesn't quite fit in with the others, but I think you may find him very relatable. Ha ha! I see you are confused. You will see what I mean when you meet him.
106_start_transition2_1=You guys are weird, but I dig it.
105_start_node2=Oh, yes, this world. It's a wonder, isnt it? Brings things from everywhere and everywhen, and probably everyWHY, for all I know. Sometimes, all you can do is just accept that things are nuts and just focus on what's in front of you. Like for instance: I have a heck of a time controlling this crazy body of mine. It takes me five minutes just to find the right levers to get up from a chair.
105_start_node3=[moves around, tests arms and legs] Young man, you've done it! Why, I can move everything with just a thought now. Before, I had to know every command by heart. This is incredible. This is going to speed up everything I do by about 20 times!
105_start_node4=Well, you have shown that you are an able mechanic. Perhaps you are just as good a scientist. I am currently studying the effects that the gems of this world have on the mechanisms we already use. The gems appear to come from a central source -- a source we assume is the Citadel, which I assume L34D3R has told you about already. We think that if we can integrate the gems into our robotic designs, we can increase their speed, strength, anything. The Citadel's the limit, don't you know?
105_start_node5=These gems are too powerful to be house in any metal other than meteorite. It's pretty rare, so we don't have that much lying around. We didn't think we'd need it this badly. We know where there is more ore, but it's dangerous to get. You know, the usual: inside fire caves, guarded by monsters. Could you help us with that?
105_start_transition2_1=Maybe I can help. I had to tinker with my arm for quite a while before I got all the kinks out of it. [take a look] Oh yeah, give me a second. I can fix this.
105_start_transition3_1=Happy to help. Can I help you with anything else?
105_start_transition4_1=What can I do?
105_start_transition5_1=That sounds like my kind of science. [crack knuckles and head out] Be back soon!
110_start_node2=Yes, yes, the King. It fall from the sky, and kill our old king. Smash him right there in throne. Rules of combat say it now king! Do you want to meet him?
110_start_node3=Here he is! Very wise. Lots of presence. Make many beeps. Better than old king. Him talk too much.
110_start_node4=No! You not take king! It best king we ever have!! Brothers! Sisters! This traveler trying to take our king!! Get him!
110_start_node5=No. Us not understand it. That part of why it so wise. We ask it if we should hunt for food. It beep. So we hunt for food. We ask if we should attack neighboring tribe. It beep. We attack tribe and win. It so wise.
110_start_node6=Oh, very typical modesty from king! One of the things we like about it. Tell king we even more impressed with it now.
110_start_node7=Hmm. This never happen before. Usually kings are kings until they are killed by something falling from the sky. Me guess that if king want to go, he pass some tests.
110_start_node8=Sure. This no challenge for king. Too wise. You help, you not help, no difference.
110_start_node9=First test easy one. I know king do a great job, but you maybe find it difficult. Traveler must kill big creature of jungle. King probably beep it to death in two seconds.
110_start_transition2_1=Uh, sure.
110_start_transition3_1=Ohh-kay. Listen, I need to take this king away. Sorry about this.
110_start_transition3_2=Oh. Well, lucky I happened along. I happen to understand this king. He comes from my country of... uh... Beeplandia. Do you know what he's saying?
110_start_transition4_1=Wait, wait!!
110_start_transition5_1=Right. Well, I'm listening to it right now, and it's saying that it doesn't want to be king anymore. It says it's not worthy, and that you should get another king.
110_start_transition6_1=Um, okay, I will, but it's asking me now if there's any way that it can step down from being king.
110_start_transition7_1=Tests? The king? But he's just a... uh...Well, can I assist him while he does it?
110_start_transition8_1=Okay, what are they?
110_start_transition9_1=[sigh] Okay, here "we" go.
110_finish_node3=Klooka say she will. Klooka, don't throw you's life away! Ha ha, just kidding, Klooka. You be happy. Okay, Metal king, you finish it up.
110_finish_transition3_1=All right, you're married. Live it up, kids. Me and the metal king are out! Later!
109_give_explorers_node2=Creator, we Created are meant for one task, and we do it to the best of our programming. But you have the ability to see your way around a problem. I am in awe. Yes, let us set up a massive council of the factions and see if we cannot find some common goals. Will you do this with us. You are the key to this agreement, Creator!
109_give_explorers_transition2_1=Absolutely.
109_finish_node2=Lucifred: Ahh, thank you, young human for giving me this chance to speak, when there seems to be no reason to hear from anyone other than the Created. They're your favorite, are they not? Oh, such a confused expression. Isn't that interesting. Well, let me tell you what the Forgers think: We are interested in the secrets of the Citadel too, but not, I'm afraid, to share. If the Created, or -- oh dear me -- the Forest Brotherhood were to know the same secrets we know, what would be the point? If they had the same knowledge we had, where would be our edge? Hmm? These fools would use the knowledge for science or harmony with nature or some other such nonsense instead of gathering power and riches. No. Although we have the resources to help you, we shall not. We shall marshall our own forces and conquer on our own, no matter how long it takes.
109_finish_node3=Fentus: Yes. Hello, Stone Pants. Thank you for putting together this meeting. We of the Forest Brotherhood are committed to a balanced way of living. A way in tune with the natural rhythms of the world around us. The shift of the stars. The curl of the fern. The music of the birds. There is wisdom in all of these things, far more than in the clunky engines we manufacture for our own convenience. The barrier around the Citadel is one that certainly could be breached with our help -- it is simply a matter of becoming attuned to the world. But why should we do this? To enter the Citadel, and learn how to build more loud, smelly engines which spoil our world -- why would we help such a goal?
109_finish_node4=Lucifred: Those who give before they are given to are suckers, Mr. Gromov. I have no desire to make any of the Forgers into the fools that are ground under the wheels of progress.
109_finish_node5=Fentus: You may think us fools, but your fear of the beautiful and savage lands and beasts that surround you imprison you in your cities. Who is weak now, when you cannot even poke your head out to see your surroundings?
109_finish_node6=L34D3R: Both of your cursed groups are blind to all but your one desire. Helping us in this project is helping everyone. We are the ones who only wish to spread knowledge, to look over the wall at the Citadel's secrets.
109_finish_node7=Lucifred: No, and if I know Fentus, there is no way he would either. For a different reason, of course: he's a credulous fool. This is pointless, and the Forgers hereby withdraw all of our support from this initiative. Do not contact us again, or you will be attacked.
109_finish_node8=Fentus: Agreed, as much as it pains me to admit it. The Forest Brotherhood will have no alliance with either faction, and shall mark them both as enemies starting now. Good day.
109_finish_node9=L34D3R: Creator, It's no more than I expected. I'm sorry. Instead of bringing them together, we've started the war that will tear them apart.
109_finish_transition2_1=Uhhh, okay. That's not very helpful. Fentus from the Forest Brotherhood, how about you?
109_finish_transition3_1=What-- If no one will cooperate, no one gets anything they want. Would you all rather suffer in silence than help each other?
109_finish_transition4_1=But--
109_finish_transition5_1=If you would --
109_finish_transition6_1=Yes! Yes, I agree. Can't all of you look beyond your own squabbles and work together?
109_finish_transition7_1=Attacked? But--
109_finish_transition8_1=None of you?
109_finish_transition9_1=Oh, no.
IC_004_start_node2=I will get the coordinates of the Created Shard. I will get this information. It's just numbers. You worry about the Brotherhood and the Forgers. They've got personalities and problems that need solving. You'll do great.
IC_004_start_transition2_1=Really? You can do this? I can do this? Okay. Okay, let's do this.
IC_005_start_node2=Uh... right. So listen. You gotta go back to them. They've got a guy that they consider a shaman who once made it to the Patriarch and got into the Library of Wisdom that has all the information you need.
IC_005_start_node3=Yeah. Crazy as a football bat. I don't know what your conversation is going to be like, but uh... good luck!
IC_005_start_transition2_1=Oh. So is this guy...
IC_005_start_transition3_1=Ohhhh-kay.
115_start_node2=Who knows what me mean? Me slightly crazy. But something need to happen to you and cleanse you's soul. Maybe in that place over there.
115_start_transition2_1=Okay, I'll go take a look.
115_daive_after_kill_castle_node2=Gromov... Kid, you were never the pilot of our plane. You-- you were just some kid who wanted to fix engines. And hey, you were good at it. But no one was ready to believe in you. You rebuilt the engine of one of our old junkers, and you were so proud of it. So sure. But none of the other pilots would show you the respect of trying it out and flying it.
115_daive_after_kill_castle_node3=Yeah. Except me. You and I both got in, and heck, it flew like a dream. Barrel rolls all across the sky. Those guys on the ground didn't know what they were missing.
115_daive_after_kill_castle_node4=But whatever you did to the engine, kid, it was way too powerful. It tore loose from the wing, and... this black smoke everywhere... well, that's all I remember.
115_daive_after_kill_castle_node5=Hey, what are friends for, huh? Survivors have gotta work together. Let's leave it for now. Focus on what needs to be done.
115_daive_after_kill_castle_transition2_1=Except you.
115_daive_after_kill_castle_transition3_1=But...
115_daive_after_kill_castle_transition4_1=Oh my god. And you...but...why aren't you angry with me? I feel like you should be FURIOUS.
115_daive_after_kill_castle_transition5_1=Yeah. If you'd even WANT my help anymore.
116_creatures_terminal_node2=The meaning of life is kindness.
116_creatures_terminal_node3=Your friend is as healthy as can be expected after a plane crash.
116_creatures_terminal_transition0_2=What is the meaning of life?
116_creatures_terminal_transition2_1=Is my friend okay?
116_creatures_terminal_transition2_2=RESTART
116_creatures_terminal_transition3_1=Uh...Okay.
IC_007_start_node2=Well, listen, man, we can't waste time being all upset about things we can't change. If you got the information, you're all set to get to the citadel. All we need to do now is craft the portal!
IC_007_start_node3=Then here's where you need to make your decision. Any one of the factions can give you that workforce and help you build it, but now is when you need to choose. You have to declare your loyalty and see it through to the end with them. Have you made your choice?
IC_007_start_transition2_1=Yeah, but that's outside my skillset-- I need a lot of help if I"m going to build something that complex.
IC_007_start_transition3_1=I... I think so. You're right. Time to be decisive. I will go to them right now and let them know I'm on their side.
117_choose_daemons_node2=Isn't this interesting. We have a method for finding the proper point, and I will arrange for the workers. Good to have you with us, Little Human.
117_choose_daemons_transition2_1=Okay, let's go.
118_start_node2=Ah, not so tooled up as you, Machine Boy. Just a man. A kind, good man, but with so much anger in his eyes. Seems a shame, but he disturbed me. And all who disturb me -- if they live -- shall die.
118_start_node3=Oh, I left him over there. Oh, did you know him? Do you miss him? Don't you have some comforting fantasy about him being part of something greater after he dies?
118_start_transition2_1=Who? Who was it?
118_start_transition3_1=[look frantically around]
015_start_node3=>gzzt< Nah, Fox told me to get her three silver plants and she'll give me silver paint. Total coincidence.
015_start_transition3_1=Oh, of course.
046_start_node3=You must purify yourself in the lake to the south. Hurry, human, I can't hold off this creature much longer!
pack_random_get_crystals_special_node0=We want to mine gems. But the noise attracts monsters. Protect us, and we'll share the take. Deal?
pack_random_get_crystals_special_transition0_1=Deal.
pack_random_get_crystals_special_transition0_2=MORE killing? No way.
pack_random_get_crystals_special_finish_node0=You did it! Here's your reward: some gems.
pack_random_get_crystals_special_finish_transition0_1=Cool, I'm happy.
pack_random_get_crystals_special_dead_finish_node0=[You see a dead miner. His meager belongings are scattered around the corpse. Some of them look useful.]
pack_random_get_crystals_special_dead_finish_transition0_1=Hmm... I could use this [Take it]
pack_random_get_crystals_special_dead_finish_transition0_2=Leave everything as is.
084_clear_first_node0=It's just going to get worse. Go on, we'll wait here.
084_clear_first_transition0_1=Worse? Okay.
084_clear_second_node0=You did it, but the portal is guarded by horrible monsters. I don't like your chances.
084_clear_second_transition0_1=I can.
046_start_transition3_1=Okay, okay! I'm going!
IC_014_DaveCall_node0=Gromov, have you already met the Lucifred's personal robot assistant?
IC_014_DaveCall_node1=That's it. This thing can be very useful. He's fluent in over 6 forms of communiction. Just take a look.
IC_014_DaveCall_transition0_1=This rusty robot?
IC_014_DaveCall_transition1_1=I'm on my way!
