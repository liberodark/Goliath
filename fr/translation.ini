Dialogue_017_start_Node_Node:1_Tranlation_02dc4ab5-2ae0-45f2-90c6-09d37480f744=OK! I’ll go and tame your glutton.
Dialogue_017_finish_Node_Begin_Tranlation_02266663-2282-4b2d-8afa-8b0d41545463=What about my certificate?
Dialogue_017_finish_Node_Node:1=I’ll give you my old certificate. It’s expired and contains my name, but you still can use it to enter the town. Show it to gnarks, and they will let you in. They can’t read, but look at the coat of arms.  If you decide to be a trader, let me know. In one or two hundred years you’ll learn all tricks.
Dialogue_017_finish_Node_Node:1_Tranlation_17555295-eaae-40e2-bbf4-88fa46c457fe=Thanks, I’ll think it over.

Dialogue_018_start_Node_Node:1_Tranlation_8483b224-6c93-4f33-a006-b38a898e6e94=OK! I’ll fetch something to drink for you.

Dialogue_020_start_Node_Begin_Tranlation_ff3bd029-a072-4f7b-a6f5-87d18b524efe=I need your stag...
Dialogue_020_start_Node_Node:1=I’ll give it up if you bring me seeds from the demons’ market. I’ll collect harvest three times a year with these seeds. Bring them and the stag is yours.
Dialogue_020_start_Node_Node:1_Tranlation_005e4acd-9eba-4786-9f9b-688c23fa3f9f=Fine! I’ll bring the seeds.
Dialogue_020_finish_Node_Begin_Tranlation_c06e1906-ac16-4124-b70f-c9cd202110e0=Be sure - these are the best seeds on the market.
Dialogue_020_finish_Node_Node:1=Great! I’ll go and plant them. Here’s the stag. Take a good care of it. I’ll treat it like my child. Don’t allow it approach fire. High temperatures are bad for it.
Dialogue_020_finish_Node_Node:1_Tranlation_ec768284-9c4f-4b39-b1a7-5e24b08b9f21=Okay! I’ll remember this. Goodbye!
Dialogue_021_start_Node_Begin=Now fight against the black stag on the arena. And then I’ll see whether you can fight and run errands.
Dialogue_021_finish_Node_Begin=That was the fight! You were so good at defeating it! I thought it will turn you to ashes, but you managed it! Great job! You have my respect!
Dialogue_021_start_Node_Begin_Tranlation_7bd504b1-e27f-4690-bcd1-b5d13e680533=I’m ready.

Dialogue_007_start_Node_Node:2=I'm glad you asked! I made a potion, and I need a brave volunteer to test it. It's nothing complicated! Just go to where there's a bunch of monsters, drink the potion, fight them, and, if you win, which you will, tell me what happened.
Dialogue_007_start_Node_Node:3=I've never made a battle potion before, but I'm an excellent cook! The creatures here love my mushroom soup! You'll be fine! At least I hope so... You're the hero! What is there to be afraid of?

Dialogue_022_start_Node_Node:1_Tranlation_d8f432c6-9a0e-45b1-ae02-b4ba9fe92e1b=It’s so nice to see that you worry about your friends. OK! I’ll help.
